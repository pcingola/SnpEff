## SnpEff

Genetic variant annotation, and functional effect prediction toolbox.
It annotates and predicts the effects of genetic variants on genes and proteins (such as amino acid changes).

Features:

* Supports over **38,000 genomes**.
* Standard **ANN** annotation format
* **Cancer** variants analysis
* **GATK** compatible (`-o gatk`)
* **HGVS** notation
* **Sequence Ontology** standardized terms
* Implements [VCF annotation standard `ANN` field](adds/VCFannotationformat_v1.0.pdf).

##  SnpSift

SnpSift annotates genomic variants using databases, filters, and manipulates genomic annotated variants.

Once you annotated your files using SnpEff, you can use SnpSift to help you filter large genomic datasets in order to find the most significant variants for your experiment.

## Galaxy & GATK

SnpEff is integrated with other tools commonly used in sequencing data analysis pipelines.

Most notably [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) and [GATK](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) projects support SnpEff.

##  In memory of Dr. Xiangyi Lu

[Please donate](xiangyi_lu_donate.md)

![](images/xiangy_small.jpg){: .right}

On October 22, 2017, Xiangyi Lu, a co-author on the SnpEff and SnpSift papers, died of ovarian cancer after a three year struggle.

Douglas Ruden, Xiangyi's husband and senior author on the papers, has requested that a non-mandatory gift of at least $10 for using
SnpEff or SnpSift be donated to WSU to honor Xiangyi Lu. All gifts will go to a fund named "The Xiangyi Lu Graduate Student Fellowship in Bioinformatics Fund."
with the goal of raising $1 million, in order to permanently endow one graduate student research position in bioinformatics every year.

Bug reports Please send any bug reports by creating issues in repositories: SnpEff: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff SnpSift: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpSift Important: In order to assess and fix the issue, I must be able to reproduce exactly the error condition. This means that I need the following information: Item Explanation Example What? A clear explanation of the bug condition. Please copy the full stack trace if one is available. \"a RuntimeException occurss when trying to annotate...\" How? A minimal bug-demonstrating test case \"when running the following command/s...\". Make sure you send the exact command lines you are using. Which? Which organism and genome version you are using (if applicable) \"we use GRCh37.72\" Version Which SnpEFf version and sub-version you are using? Make sure to try the latest version since the bug might be already fixed. \"we are using SnpEFf 3.3H\"). Hint: Running java -jar snpEff.jar shows version information. Command line The full command line that shows the issue. java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar GRCh37.75 sample.vcf ... Data Sample data enough to reproduce the conditions Always attach the data files such as VCF lines (even if you added some snippets in the email's body) \"find attached a sample of the VCF file...\" Results What you expect to obtain (if applicable) \"we expected result X, but we obtained Y instead...\" Important tips: Make sure you attached a minimal dataset to reproduce the error condition. For instance, a few VCF lines showing the problem are enough (sometimes one VCF line is enough), I don't need your full VCF file. Always send the data attached , even if it's only one VCF line. There are two reasons for this: Many times the problem is a malformed line, which I can only asses if the data is attached, and I receive many emails, so reformatting copied & pasted lines is a waste of time. If you have to send large files, as sometimes happens with genome references, try uploading them to a server (e.g. Google Drive) and sending me a link. Also remember to compress them. Try SnpEff's latest version. SnpEff is updated often, may be the bug has already been corrected (e.g you are using version 3.1A, but I've already fixed it in version 3.1B). 4. Asking for help Please send any questions by creating issues in repositories: SnpEff: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff SnpSift: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpSift Important: In order to assess and your problem precisely, I must be able to reproduce your example. request for help should include at least the following items: Item Explanation Example What? A clear explanation of what you are trying to achieve \"I want to annotate variants... and then filter them to obtain...\" How? A minimal demonstration of how you are trying to do it \"we run the following command...\". Make sure you send the exact command lines you are using. Which? Which organism and genome version you are using \"we are analyzing human samples using GRCh37.72 reference genome\" Version Which SnpEFf version and sub-version you are using? Make sure to try the latest version since the issue might be already solved. \"we are using SnpEFf 3.3H\"). Hint: Running java -jar snpEff.jar shows version information. Command line The full command line that shows the issue. java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar GRCh37.75 sample.vcf ... Data Sample data enough to reproduce the conditions Always attach the data files such as VCF lines (even if you added some snippets in the email's body) \"find attached a sample of the VCF file...\" Results What you expect to obtain \"we wanted to get information on variants that affect splcie regions...\" Note: A few guidelines when asking for help... Use the latest version. SnpEff is updated often, may be the issue has already been corrected (e.g you are using version 3.1A, but I've already fixed it in version 3.1B). Read the documentation first. Please make sure you've read the documentation before asking fo help. I know this is obvious, but a lot of people ask for questions in that are answered or shown as examples in the documentation. If the documentation did not help. I'm aware that the documentation is not always \"easy reading\" and I'm not Shakespeare. So let me know which part of the manual is confusing, outdated or plain wrong. I'm always trying to update and improve the docs. Be polite. Again, it may be obvious, but you cannot imagine the number of emails I get saying something like: \"I'm doing [something very wrong] and it doesn't work, so it' your fault because your program must have a bug!\" or sometimes: \"You must drop everything you are doing and do my job for me right now!\" Sometimes I'm too busy. I always try to help people, but sometimes I'm too busy and I won't be able to answer your emails in due time and manner. Apologies in advanced. If I don't get back to you... Do remind me if I don't get back to you within a few days. Sometimes I'm swamped with work or just out of town, a polite reminder helps. Keep in mind that this is not an invitation for you to spam me every single day because I didn't have time to answer your first email. Ask for too much advice. I don't mind helping, I've been doing it forever. However I won't be able to help you with all the details (due to limited time), so most times, the best I can do is to provide some pointers and general advise. 5. Asking for new features I always take into account features request. So don't hesitate to send me your ideas by creating issues in repositories: SnpEff: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff SnpSift: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpSift Of course, it doesn't mean I'll get all suggestions implemented as soon as I get an email. But if a lot of people are asking for the same feature, it is a strong indicator that I should try to implement it sooner rather than later. Please, don't be frustrated if I tell you I cannot implement your suggestion / idea. Keep in mind that some features are impossible to implement for different reasons, e.g.: SnpEff uses some standard (e.g. VCF) and new features cannot break those standards. SnpEff is used by a LOT of people in MANY different pipelines. New features must be compatible with current infrastructure and cannot break operational production pipelines. Some feature requests are just too difficult to implement 6. Asking for new database / genome I'm willing to help you out if you need to build a new database (a.k.a. add a new reference genome). Building a new database (i.e. adding a new reference genome) is relatively easy and the procedure is described in detail in the documentation . If you are unable to build the database, I can try to help you out. Please, create issue in repository: https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff . In order to do so, I need you to send me the following information: Name of the species Reference genome version A link to the reference genome sequence (i.e. a link to the FASTA file) A link to a gene and transcript definition file (either GTF, GFF, GenBank, etc.) At least one of the following (preferably, both): A link to the CDS sequences (FASTA file) A link to the protein sequences (FASTA files) Codon table information (take a look a the codon tables in snpEff.config file): Which codon table does the organism use? (e.g. codon.Standard or codon.Mycoplasma ). Specific codon tables used by some chromosomes (e.g. chromosome 'MT' uses codon.Vertebrate_Mitochondrial table) I'm well aware that I could try to google that information myself, but I need you to send the information because I want to be absolutely sure we are using exactly the reference genome version, sub-version, and data files you need. 7.

Download SnpEff Old versions here . License SnpEff is open source, released as \"LGPLv3\". System requirements SnpEff requires that you have Java v1.8 or later installed (any modern operating system has it). The amount of memory used can vary significantly depending on genome size and data analysis type you are doing. For large genomes, such as the human genome, you'll probably need at least 4Gb of memory. Installing SnpEff Installing SnpEff is very easy, you just have to uncompress the ZIP file. How to install using command line (unix systems) It is better if you install SnpEff in snpEff directory in your home directory ( $HOME/snpEff in unix systems). # Go to home dir cd # Download latest version wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip # Unzip file unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip Configuration In most cases you DO NOT need to configure anything. The only configuration file is snpEff.config . Most configuration parameters, are explained in the comments in the same config file, so I won't repeat the explanation here :-) Usually you do NOT need to change the configuration.

Computer hardware: The materials required for this protocol are: a computer running a Unix operating system (Linux, OS.X), at least 4GB of RAM at least 1Gb of free disk space, Java version 1.8 or higher installed, and a reasonably fast internet connection. Users of Windows computers can install CygWin, a free Linux-like environment for Windows, although the precise commands listed in the protocol may need to adapted. Software: We use the SnpEff annotation program and its companion tool SnpSift. These programs can perform annotation, primary impact assessment and variants filtering, as well as many other tasks beyond the scope of this protocol. We highly recommend reading their comprehensive documentation available here . Before starting the protocol, it is necessary to download and install SnpEff. To do this, open a Unix, Linux or Cygwin shell and execute the following commands: # Move to home directory cd # Download and install SnpEff curl -v -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip > snpEff_latest_core.zip unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip Notes: SnpEff & SnpSift annotation software used in this protocol are under very active development and some command line option may change in the future. The standard installation is to add the package in the \"$HOME/snpEff\" directory (where $HOME is your home directory). To install SnpEff elsewhere, update the \"data_dir\" parameter in your \"snpEff.config\" file, as described in the SnpEff documentation. Once SnpEff is installed, we will enter the following commands to download the pre-built human database (GRCh37.75) that will be used to annotate our data. cd snpEff java -jar snpEff.jar download -v GRCh37.75 A list of pre-built databases for all other species is available by running the following command: java -jar snpEff.jar databases Example 1: Coding variants We show how to use SnpEff & SnpSift to annotate, prioritize and filter coding variants. Dataset: In this genomic annotation example, we use a simulated dataset to show how to find genetic variants of a Mendelian recessive disease, Cystic fibrosis, caused by a high impact coding variant, a nonsense mutation in CFTR gene (G542*). The data files come from the publicly available \"CEPH_1463\" dataset, sequenced by Complete Genomics , and contains sequencing information for a family consisting of 4 grandparents, 2 parents and 11 siblings. Although these are healthy individuals, we artificially introduced a known Cystic fibrosis mutation on three siblings (cases) in a manner that was consistent with the underlying haplotype structure. We now download and un-compress the example data used in this protocol, which, for reasons of space and time, is limited to only chromosome 7 and 17: # Go to SnpEff's dir cd ~/snpEff # Download sample data curl -v -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/protocols.zip > protocols.zip unzip protocols.zip The goal in this example is to use SnpEff to find a mutation causing a Mendelian recessive trait. This will be done using a dataset of variant calls for chromosome 7 from a pedigree of 17 healthy individuals, sequenced by Complete Genomics, in which a coding variant causing cystic fibrosis was artificially introduced in three siblings (see Materials). For the purpose of this example, we assume that we do not know the causative variant, but that we know that we are dealing with a Mendelian recessive disorder, where the three siblings are affected (cases), but the 14 parents and grandparents are not (controls). Genomic variants are usually provided in a VCF file containing variant information of all the samples; storing the variant data in a single VCF file is the standard practice, not only because variant calling algorithms have better accuracy when run on all samples simultaneously, but also because it is much easier to annotate, manipulate and compare individuals when the data is stored and transferred together. A caveat of this approach is that VCF files can become very large when performing experiments with thousands of samples (from several Gigabytes to Terabytes in size). In the following protocol, SnpEff will add annotation fields to each variant record in the input VCF file. We will then use SnpSift, a filtering program to extract the most significant variants having annotations meeting certain criteria. Step 1: Primary variant annotation and quality control. Our first step is to annotate each of the ~500,000 variants contained in the VCF file. By default, SnpEff adds primary annotations and basic impact assessment for coding and non-coding variants as described above. SnpEff has several command line options that can be used in this annotation stage and which are described in detail in the online manual . In this example, we annotate (all these annotations are activated by default when using SnpEff): loss of function and nonsense mediated decay predictions; protein domain annotations from the curated NextProt database; putative transcription factor binding sites from the ENSEMBL 'Regulatory Build' and Jaspar database; use HGVS notation for amino acid changes; and to create a web page summarizing the annotation results in \"ex1.html\" (option -stats ): java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v -stats ex1.html GRCh37.75 protocols/ex1.vcf > protocols/ex1.ann.vcf SnpEff produces three output files : the HTML file containing summary statistics about the variants and their annotations; an annotated VCF file; and a text file summarizing the number of variant types per gene. Creation of the summary files can be de-activated to speed up the program (for example, when the application is used together with Galaxy). By default, the statistics file \"ex1.html\" is a standard HTML file that can be opened in any web browser to view quality control (QC) metrics. It can also be created in comma-separated values format (CSV) to be used by downstream processing programs as part of an automated pipeline. In our example, the summary file contains basic quality control statistics calculated from the variant file: for our data, the Ts/Ts ratio is close to 2.0 (Figure 1c) and missense / silent ratio is around 1.0 (Figure 1d), both of which are expected for human data (but these numbers may differ for other species). Large deviations from the expected values for the organism being sequenced might indicate problems with either the sequencing or variant calling pipelines. The summary file also contains QC information for the gene annotation used as input. In this example, 829 warnings (Figure 1a) were identified as a result of possible genomic annotation errors or small inconsistencies identified in the reference genome so we have to be careful analyzing those genes/transcripts. Other summary statistics are available, such as variant types (Figure 1e), variants effects (Figure 1d and 1g), and primary impacts (Figure 1b and 1g). Step 2: Counting variants in case and control subjects. In the first step of our protocol, SnpEff created a VCF file with half million annotated variants. Rather than scanning each annotation manually, we will use the SnpSift program to create a filter that will identify a small subset of variants with interesting functional properties. Since the VCF files used in most sequencing studies are even larger than the one in this example, our overall approach is to start by creating a filter using a very restrictive set of criteria. If no relevant variant is found using this stringent filter, we will relax the criteria to include variants with lower predicted impact. In our example, since the pedigree is consistent with a Mendelian recessive disease, so we will first use SnpEff to find high impact variants that are homozygous in cases and either absent or heterozygous in controls. This provides a very strong genetic argument to select the promising variants and will be used as the first step in our filter. To do this, we will identify the case and control samples by providing SnpEff with pedigree information using a \"TFAM\" file (a standard file format used to describe pedigrees). In our example, the TFAM file (\"pedigree.tfam\") identifies the three cases (NA12879, NA12885, NA12886), and lists the other family members as controls. The \"caseControl\" command instructs the SnpSift program to count the number homozygous non-reference, heterozygous and allele count (number of non-reference alleles in each DNA sample) for both cases and controls groups (running time: ~60 minutes): java -Xmx1g -jar SnpSift.jar \\ caseControl \\ -v \\ -tfam protocols/pedigree.tfam \\ protocols/ex1.ann.vcf \\ > protocols/ex1.ann.cc.vcf This analysis creates an output VCF file (\"ex1.ann.cc.vcf\") by adding new information to the INFO field for each variant: this includes information such as Cases=1,1,3 and Controls=8,6,22 which correspond to the number of homozygous non-reference, heterozygous and total allele counts in cases and controls for each variant. The program also calculates basic statistics for each variant based on the allele frequencies in the two groups using different models, which can be useful as a starting point for more in-depth statistical analysis. Step 3: Filtering variants. We can use the SnpSift filter command to reduce the number of candidate loci base on alleles in cases and controls. SnpSift filter allows users to create powerful filters that select variants using Boolean expressions containing data from the VCF fields. The expression we use to filter the VCF file \"ex1.ann.vcf\" is developed as follows. We expect all the three cases and none of the controls to be homozygous for the mutation. This is expressed using the following filter: (Cases[0] = 3) & (Controls[0] = 0) The full command line is: cat protocols/ex1.ann.cc.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \\ \"(Cases[0] = 3) & (Controls[0] = 0)\" \\ > protocols/ex1.filtered.hom.vcf The filtered output file, filtered.hom_cases.vcf, contains over 400 variants satisfying our criteria. This is still too large to analyze by hand, so can we can add another filter to see if any of these variants is expected to have a high impact. To identify variants where any of these impacts is classified as either HIGH or MODERATE we add the condition (ANN[*].IMPACT = 'HIGH') | (ANN[*].IMPACT = 'MODERATE') . The new filtering commands become: cat protocols/ex1.ann.cc.vcf \\ | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \\ \"(Cases[0] = 3) & (Controls[0] = 0) & ((ANN[*].IMPACT = 'HIGH') | (ANN[*].IMPACT = 'MODERATE'))\" \\ > protocols/ex1.filtered.vcf After filtering, only two variants satisfy our criteria, one of them is a stop_gained loss of function variant, whereas the other one is a missense_variant amino acid change. The first one is a known Cystic fibrosis variant. $ cat protocols/ex1.filtered.vcf | ./scripts/vcfInfoOnePerLine.pl 7 117227832 . G T . .

Annotations and impact assessment software needs to provide integration points with other analysis steps of the pipeline. In the following paragraphs we describe how to integrate SnpEff with two programs commonly used in sequencing analysis pipelines: Genome Analysis toolkit (GATK 2), a command-line driven software; Galaxy 3, a web based software. GATK The Genome Analysis Toolkit 2 is one of the most popular programs for bioinformatics pipelines. Annotations can be easily integrated into GATK using SnpEff and GATK's VariantAnnotator module. Here we show how to annotate a file using SnpEff and GATK, as an alternative way of performing step 1. You should perform this step only if your processing pipeline is based on GATK: compared to running SnpEff from the command line, the results obtained when using GATK will only contain the highest impact annotation for each variant. This was a conscious trade-off made by the designers of GATK, partly because most biologists do this implicitly when reading a list of variants, but also to improve the readability and reduce the size of the annotation results. The method requires two steps: Annotating a VCF file using SnpEff Using GATK's VariantAnnotator to incorporate those annotations into the final VCF file. When using SnpEff for GATK compatibility, we must use the -o gatk command line option: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar \\ -v \\ -o gatk \\ GRCh37.75 \\ protocols/ex1.vcf \\ > protocols/ex1.ann.gatk.vcf Next, we process these variants using GATK. For this step to work correctly, we need to make sure that our data files are compatible with the requirements GATK places on reference genomes (see GATK's documentation for more details): in the fasta file, chromosomes are expected to be sorted in karyotypic order; a genome fasta-index file must be available; and a dictionary file must be pre-computed. Assuming these requirements are satisfied, we can run the following command, which will produce a GATK annotated file (\"ex1.gatk.vcf\"): java -Xmx4g -jar $HOME/tools/gatk/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\ -T VariantAnnotator \\ -R $HOME/genomes/GRCh37.75.fa \\ -A SnpEff \\ --variant protocols/ex1.vcf \\ --snpEffFile protocols/ex1.ann.gatk.vcf \\ -L protocols/ex1.vcf \\ -o protocols/ex1.gatk.vcf Note: We assumed GATK is installed in \"$HOME/tools/gatk/\" and the reference genome is contained in \"$HOME/genomes/GRCh37.75.fa\" These file locations should be adapted to the actual path in your computer. Galaxy Anther popular tool in bioinformatics is Galaxy 3, which allows pipelines to be created in a web environment using graphical interface, making it flexible and straightforward to use. SnpEff provides Galaxy modules . Once these modules are installed, we can run our sample annotation pipeline in Galaxy. Example 3: Non-Coding variants We show how to use SnpEff & SnpSift to annotate, prioritize and filter non-coding variants. Dataset: This example shows how to perform basic annotation of non-coding variants. It is based on a short list of 20 non-coding that were identified by sequencing a 700 kb region surrounding the gene T-box transcription factor (TBX5) in 260 patients with congenital heart disease 67. TBX5 is a transcription factor that plays a well-established dosage-dependent role in heart and limb development. Coding mutations in TBX5 have been frequently identified in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome, which is associated with abnormal hand, forearm and cardiac development. Data source : Regulatory variation in a TBX5 enhancer leads to isolated congenital heart disease . Step 1. Annotating variants. We will perform non-coding variant annotation using SnpEff following a similar approach to Procedure I. In this case, we construct a command line that instructs SnpEff to include motif information (\"-motif\") and putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) identified in the ENSEMBL Regulatory Build and the Jaspar database: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar \\ -v \\ -motif \\ GRCh37.75 \\ protocols/ex2.vcf \\ > protocols/ex2.ann.basic.vcf Step 2. Adding custom regulatory information. A quick scan through the results shows that most variants are catalogued as \"INTERGENIC\", and none of them is associated with a known TFBS. This is not surprising since TFBS are small and also because regulatory elements involved in cardiac or limb development may not be widely active in commonly studied adult tissues. In this case, basic annotations did not provide additional information that can be used to narrow down the list of candidate SNVs. To solve this, the authors examined data from other sources, including ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1 (a post-translationally modified histone protein found in transcriptionally active genome regions, including enhancers and promoters). Data produced from ChIP-Seq analysis are frequently published in BED, BigBed or similar formats, which can be used directly by SnpEff by adding the -interval command line option. This command line option can be used to add annotations using ChIP-Seq experiments from the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects: since multiple -interval options are allowed in each command line, it is a simple way to combine several annotations: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar \\ -v \\ -motif \\ -interval protocols/ex2_regulatory.bed \\ GRCh37.75 \\ protocols/ex2.vcf \\ > protocols/ex2.ann.vcf In the output VCF file, variants intersecting genomic regions from the -interval command line option are annotated as \"CUSTOM[ex2_regulatory]\" : the name in brackets identifies the file name provided to distinguish multiple annotation files. Step 3. Adding conservation information. In order to refine our search, we can also look for variants in highly conserved non-coding bases. SnpEff natively supports PhastCons scores, but can also add annotations based on any other user-defined score provided as a Wig or VCF file. The command line for annotating using the PhastCons score is: java -Xmx1g -jar SnpSift.jar \\ phastCons \\ -v \\ protocols/phastcons \\ protocols/ex2.ann.vcf \\ > protocols/ex2.ann.cons.vcf Now we can filter our results looking for a highly conserved SNP in the regulatory region. We do this by using a \"SnpSift filter\" command and the appropriate Boolean expression: cat protocols/ex2.ann.cons.vcf \\ | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \\ \"(ANN[*].EFFECT = 'CUSTOM[ex2_regulatory]') & (exists PhastCons) & (PhastCons > 0.9)\" \\ > protocols/ex2.filtered.vcf SnpSift filter supports a flexible syntax to create Boolean expressions using the annotation data that provides a versatile way to prioritize shorter lists of SNPs for subsequent validation. This syntax is described in detail in the online manual . In this example, our filter results in only two candidate SNPs, one of which was extensively validated in the original study and is assumed to be causative. The principles illustrated in our example for a small set of SNVs can be applied to millions of variants from whole genome sequencing experiments. Similarly, although we filtered the SNVs using \"custom\" ChIP-seq data that provided in the original study, regulatory information from public Encode or Epigenome Roadmap datasets could be used in a first line investigation before generating our own Chip-seq or RNA-seq data using disease-relevant cells and tissues. Example 4: Sequencing data analysis Here we show an example on how to get from Sequencing data to an annotated variants file. Sequencing data example Warning This is an extremely simplified version on how to analyze the data from scratch. This is not meant to be a tutorial on sequencing analysis as it would be way beyond the scope of this handbook. Let's assume you have sequence data in FASTQ format (file \"s.fastq\") and your reference genome is dm5.34 (fly genome) # Download the genome, uncompress and rename file wget ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r5.34_FB2011_02/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.34.fasta.gz gunzip dmel-all-chromosome-r5.34.fasta.gz mv dmel-all-chromosome-r5.34.fasta dm5.34.fasta # Create a genome index (we assume you installed BWA http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) bwa index -bwtsw dm5.34.fasta # Map sequences to the genome: Create SAI file bwa aln -bwtsw dm5.34.fasta s.fastq > s.sai # Map sequences to the genome: Create SAM file bwa samse dm5.34.fasta s.sai s.fastq > s.sam # Create BAM file (we assume you installed SamTools http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) samtools view -S -b s.sam > s.bam # Sort BAM file (will create s_sort.bam) samtools sort s.bam s_sort # Create VCF file (BcfTools is part of samtools distribution) samtools mpileup -uf dm5.34.fasta s_sort.bam | bcftools view -vcg - > s.vcf # Analyze variants using snpEff java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar dm5.34 s.vcf > s.ann.vcf This highly simplified sequencing data analysis pipeline, has these basic steps: Index the reference genome (bwa) Map reads to reference genome (bwa) Call variants (bcftools) Annotate variants (SnpEff) Example 5: Filter out variants (dbSnp) Here we show an example on how to get from Sequencing data to an annotated variants file. These are slightly more advanced examples. Here we'll try to show how to perform specific tasks. If you want to filter out SNPs from dbSnp, you can do it using SnpSift. You can download SnpSift from the \"Downloads\" page. You can download the file for this example here . Here is how to do it: Annotate ID fields using SnpSift annotate and DbSnp. # Annotate ID field using dbSnp # Note: SnpSift will automatically download and uncompress dbSnp database if not locally available. java -jar SnpSift.jar annotate -dbsnp file.vcf > file.dbSnp.vcf Info We annotate using dbSnp before using SnpEff in order to have 'known' and 'unknown' statistics in SnpEff's summary page. Those stats are based on the presence of an ID field. If the ID is non-empty, then it is assumed to be a 'known variant'. Annotate using SnpEff: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar eff -v GRCh37.75 file.dbSnp.vcf > file.ann.vcf Filter out variants that have a non-empty ID field. These variants are the ones that are NOT in dbSnp, since we annotated the ID field using rs-numbers from dbSnp in step 1. java -jar SnpSift.jar filter -f file.ann.vcf \"! exists ID\" > file.ann.not_in_dbSnp.vcf Info The expression using to filter the file is \"! exists ID\". This means that the ID field does not exists (i.e. the value is empty) which is represented as a dot (\".\") in a VCF file. Pipes Obviously you can perform the three previous commands, pipeling the out from one command to the next, thus avoiding the creation of intermediate files (for very large projects, this can be a significant amount of time). Info In SnpEff & SnpSift the STDIN is denoted by file name \"-\" So the previous commands would be: java -jar SnpSif.jar annotate -dbsnp file.vcf \\ | java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar eff -v GRCh37.75 - \\ | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"! exists ID\" \\ > file.ann.not_in_dbSnp.vcf Here is an example of some entries in the annotated output file. You can see the 'ANN' field was added, predicting STOP_GAINED protein changes: $ cat demo.1kg.snpeff.vcf | grep stop_gained 1 889455 . G A 100.0 PASS ...;ANN=A|stop_gained|HIGH|... 1 897062 . C T 100.0 PASS ...;ANN=T|stop_gained|HIGH|... 1 900375 . G A 100.0 PASS ...;ANN=A|stop_gained|HIGH|... Note: The real output was edited for readability reasons. Example 6: Custom annotations SnpEff can annotate using user specified (custom) genomic intervals, allowing you to add any kind of annotations you want. In this example, we are analyzing using a specific version of the Yeast genome (we will assume that the database is not available, just to show a more complete example). We also want to add annotations of genomic regions known as 'ARS', which are defined in a GFF file. This turns out to be quite easy, thanks to SnpEff's \"custom intervals\" feature. SnpEff allows you to add \"custom\" annotations from intervals in several formats: TXT, BED, BigBed, VCF, GFF. So, for this example, we need to: Build the database: For the sake of this example, we are assuming that SnpEff doesn't have this database (which is not true in most real life situations). Create a file with the features we want to analyze (ARS) Annotate using the ARS features Step 1: Build database. Once more, this is done for the sake of the example, in real life Yeast databases are available and you don't need to build the database yourself. #--- # Download data #--- $ cd ~/snpEff $ mkdir data/sacCer $ cd data/sacCer $ wget http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/curation/chromosomal_feature/saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff $ mv saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff genes.gff Now that we've downloaded the reference genome, we can build the database: #--- # Build #--- $ cd ../.. # Add entry to config file $ echo \"sacCer.genome : Yeast\" >> snpEff.config # Build database $ java -Xmx1G -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 sacCer Step 2: Create custom annotations file. We need a file that has our features of interest (in this case, the \"ARS\" features). Since those features ara available in the original GFF (saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gff) file, we can filter the file to create our \"custom\" annotations file. #--- # Create a features file #--- # GFF files have both genomic records and sequences, we need to know # where the 'records' section ends (it is delimited by a \"##FASTA\" line) $ grep -n \"^#\" data/sacCer/genes.gff | tail -n 1 22994:##FASTA # Note that I'm cutting the INFO column (only for readability reasons) $ head -n 22994 data/sacCer/genes.gff \\ | grep -v \"^#\" \\ | grep ARS \\ | cut -f 1 -d \";\" \\ > sacCer_ARS_features.gff So now we have a custom file ready to be used. Step 3: Annotate. We built the database and we have the ARS features file, so we are ready to annotate: #--- # Features annotations example #--- # Create a fake VCF file (one line), this is just an example to show that it works $ echo -e \"chrI\\t700\\t.\\tA\\tT\\t.\\t.\\t.\" > my.vcf $ java -jar snpEff.jar -interval sacCer_features.gff sacCer my.vcf > my.ann.vcf If we take a look at the results, we can see that the \"ARS\" feature is annotates (see last line) $ cat my.ann.vcf | grep -v \"^#\" | cut -f 8 | tr \",;\" \"\\n\\n\" EFF=missense_variant(LOW|MISSENSE|Cca/Tca|p.Pro55Ser/c.163A>T|84|YAL068W-A|protein_coding|CODING|YAL068W-A_mRNA|1|1|WARNING_REF_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GENOME) upstream_gene_variant(MODIFIER||1780||75|YAL067W-A|protein_coding|CODING|YAL067W-A_mRNA||1) downstream_gene_variant(MODIFIER||1107||120|YAL068C|protein_coding|CODING|YAL068C_mRNA||1) downstream_gene_variant(MODIFIER||51||104|YAL069W|protein_coding|CODING|YAL069W_mRNA||1) custom[sacCer_features](MODIFIER||||||ARS102||||1)","title":"Usage examples"},{"location":"examples/#usage-examples","text":"","title":"Usage examples"},{"location":"examples/#materials","text":"In this protocol we show how to analyze genomic variants using the SnpEff pipeline. Computer hardware: The materials required for this protocol are: a computer running a Unix operating system (Linux, OS.X), at least 4GB of RAM at least 1Gb of free disk space, Java version 1.8 or higher installed, and a reasonably fast internet connection. Users of Windows computers can install CygWin, a free Linux-like environment for Windows, although the precise commands listed in the protocol may need to adapted. Software: We use the SnpEff annotation program and its companion tool SnpSift. These programs can perform annotation, primary impact assessment and variants filtering, as well as many other tasks beyond the scope of this protocol. We highly recommend reading their comprehensive documentation available here . Before starting the protocol, it is necessary to download and install SnpEff. To do this, open a Unix, Linux or Cygwin shell and execute the following commands: # Move to home directory cd # Download and install SnpEff curl -v -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip > snpEff_latest_core.zip unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip Notes: SnpEff & SnpSift annotation software used in this protocol are under very active development and some command line option may change in the future. The standard installation is to add the package in the \"$HOME/snpEff\" directory (where $HOME is your home directory). To install SnpEff elsewhere, update the \"data_dir\" parameter in your \"snpEff.config\" file, as described in the SnpEff documentation. Once SnpEff is installed, we will enter the following commands to download the pre-built human database (GRCh37.75) that will be used to annotate our data. cd snpEff java -jar snpEff.jar download -v GRCh37.75 A list of pre-built databases for all other species is available by running the following command: java -jar snpEff.jar databases","title":"Materials"},{"location":"examples/#example-1-coding-variants","text":"We show how to use SnpEff & SnpSift to annotate, prioritize and filter coding variants. Dataset: In this genomic annotation example, we use a simulated dataset to show how to find genetic variants of a Mendelian recessive disease, Cystic fibrosis, caused by a high impact coding variant, a nonsense mutation in CFTR gene (G542*). The data files come from the publicly available \"CEPH_1463\" dataset, sequenced by Complete Genomics , and contains sequencing information for a family consisting of 4 grandparents, 2 parents and 11 siblings. Although these are healthy individuals, we artificially introduced a known Cystic fibrosis mutation on three siblings (cases) in a manner that was consistent with the underlying haplotype structure. We now download and un-compress the example data used in this protocol, which, for reasons of space and time, is limited to only chromosome 7 and 17: # Go to SnpEff's dir cd ~/snpEff # Download sample data curl -v -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/protocols.zip > protocols.zip unzip protocols.zip The goal in this example is to use SnpEff to find a mutation causing a Mendelian recessive trait. This will be done using a dataset of variant calls for chromosome 7 from a pedigree of 17 healthy individuals, sequenced by Complete Genomics, in which a coding variant causing cystic fibrosis was artificially introduced in three siblings (see Materials). For the purpose of this example, we assume that we do not know the causative variant, but that we know that we are dealing with a Mendelian recessive disorder, where the three siblings are affected (cases), but the 14 parents and grandparents are not (controls). Genomic variants are usually provided in a VCF file containing variant information of all the samples; storing the variant data in a single VCF file is the standard practice, not only because variant calling algorithms have better accuracy when run on all samples simultaneously, but also because it is much easier to annotate, manipulate and compare individuals when the data is stored and transferred together. A caveat of this approach is that VCF files can become very large when performing experiments with thousands of samples (from several Gigabytes to Terabytes in size). In the following protocol, SnpEff will add annotation fields to each variant record in the input VCF file. We will then use SnpSift, a filtering program to extract the most significant variants having annotations meeting certain criteria.","title":"Example 1: Coding variants"},{"location":"examples/#step-1-primary-variant-annotation-and-quality-control","text":"Our first step is to annotate each of the ~500,000 variants contained in the VCF file. By default, SnpEff adds primary annotations and basic impact assessment for coding and non-coding variants as described above. SnpEff has several command line options that can be used in this annotation stage and which are described in detail in the online manual . In this example, we annotate (all these annotations are activated by default when using SnpEff): loss of function and nonsense mediated decay predictions; protein domain annotations from the curated NextProt database; putative transcription factor binding sites from the ENSEMBL 'Regulatory Build' and Jaspar database; use HGVS notation for amino acid changes; and to create a web page summarizing the annotation results in \"ex1.html\" (option -stats ): java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v -stats ex1.html GRCh37.75 protocols/ex1.vcf > protocols/ex1.ann.vcf SnpEff produces three output files : the HTML file containing summary statistics about the variants and their annotations; an annotated VCF file; and a text file summarizing the number of variant types per gene. Creation of the summary files can be de-activated to speed up the program (for example, when the application is used together with Galaxy). By default, the statistics file \"ex1.html\" is a standard HTML file that can be opened in any web browser to view quality control (QC) metrics. It can also be created in comma-separated values format (CSV) to be used by downstream processing programs as part of an automated pipeline. In our example, the summary file contains basic quality control statistics calculated from the variant file: for our data, the Ts/Ts ratio is close to 2.0 (Figure 1c) and missense / silent ratio is around 1.0 (Figure 1d), both of which are expected for human data (but these numbers may differ for other species). Large deviations from the expected values for the organism being sequenced might indicate problems with either the sequencing or variant calling pipelines. The summary file also contains QC information for the gene annotation used as input. In this example, 829 warnings (Figure 1a) were identified as a result of possible genomic annotation errors or small inconsistencies identified in the reference genome so we have to be careful analyzing those genes/transcripts. Other summary statistics are available, such as variant types (Figure 1e), variants effects (Figure 1d and 1g), and primary impacts (Figure 1b and 1g).","title":"Step 1: Primary variant annotation and quality control."},{"location":"examples/#step-2-counting-variants-in-case-and-control-subjects","text":"In the first step of our protocol, SnpEff created a VCF file with half million annotated variants. Rather than scanning each annotation manually, we will use the SnpSift program to create a filter that will identify a small subset of variants with interesting functional properties. Since the VCF files used in most sequencing studies are even larger than the one in this example, our overall approach is to start by creating a filter using a very restrictive set of criteria. If no relevant variant is found using this stringent filter, we will relax the criteria to include variants with lower predicted impact. In our example, since the pedigree is consistent with a Mendelian recessive disease, so we will first use SnpEff to find high impact variants that are homozygous in cases and either absent or heterozygous in controls. This provides a very strong genetic argument to select the promising variants and will be used as the first step in our filter. To do this, we will identify the case and control samples by providing SnpEff with pedigree information using a \"TFAM\" file (a standard file format used to describe pedigrees). In our example, the TFAM file (\"pedigree.tfam\") identifies the three cases (NA12879, NA12885, NA12886), and lists the other family members as controls. The \"caseControl\" command instructs the SnpSift program to count the number homozygous non-reference, heterozygous and allele count (number of non-reference alleles in each DNA sample) for both cases and controls groups (running time: ~60 minutes): java -Xmx1g -jar SnpSift.jar \\ caseControl \\ -v \\ -tfam protocols/pedigree.tfam \\ protocols/ex1.ann.vcf \\ > protocols/ex1.ann.cc.vcf This analysis creates an output VCF file (\"ex1.ann.cc.vcf\") by adding new information to the INFO field for each variant: this includes information such as Cases=1,1,3 and Controls=8,6,22 which correspond to the number of homozygous non-reference, heterozygous and total allele counts in cases and controls for each variant. The program also calculates basic statistics for each variant based on the allele frequencies in the two groups using different models, which can be useful as a starting point for more in-depth statistical analysis.","title":"Step 2: Counting variants in case and control subjects."},{"location":"examples/#step-3-filtering-variants","text":"We can use the SnpSift filter command to reduce the number of candidate loci base on alleles in cases and controls. SnpSift filter allows users to create powerful filters that select variants using Boolean expressions containing data from the VCF fields. The expression we use to filter the VCF file \"ex1.ann.vcf\" is developed as follows. We expect all the three cases and none of the controls to be homozygous for the mutation. This is expressed using the following filter: (Cases[0] = 3) & (Controls[0] = 0) The full command line is: cat protocols/ex1.ann.cc.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \\ \"(Cases[0] = 3) & (Controls[0] = 0)\" \\ > protocols/ex1.filtered.hom.vcf The filtered output file, filtered.hom_cases.vcf, contains over 400 variants satisfying our criteria.

To identify variants where any of these impacts is classified as either HIGH or MODERATE we add the condition (ANN[*].IMPACT = 'HIGH') | (ANN[*].IMPACT = 'MODERATE') .

Annotations can be easily integrated into GATK using SnpEff and GATK's VariantAnnotator module. Here we show how to annotate a file using SnpEff and GATK, as an alternative way of performing step 1. You should perform this step only if your processing pipeline is based on GATK: compared to running SnpEff from the command line, the results obtained when using GATK will only contain the highest impact annotation for each variant. This was a conscious trade-off made by the designers of GATK, partly because most biologists do this implicitly when reading a list of variants, but also to improve the readability and reduce the size of the annotation results. The method requires two steps: Annotating a VCF file using SnpEff Using GATK's VariantAnnotator to incorporate those annotations into the final VCF file. When using SnpEff for GATK compatibility, we must use the -o gatk command line option: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar \\ -v \\ -o gatk \\ GRCh37.75 \\ protocols/ex1.vcf \\ > protocols/ex1.ann.gatk.vcf Next, we process these variants using GATK. For this step to work correctly, we need to make sure that our data files are compatible with the requirements GATK places on reference genomes (see GATK's documentation for more details): in the fasta file, chromosomes are expected to be sorted in karyotypic order; a genome fasta-index file must be available; and a dictionary file must be pre-computed.

This is not surprising since TFBS are small and also because regulatory elements involved in cardiac or limb development may not be widely active in commonly studied adult tissues. In this case, basic annotations did not provide additional information that can be used to narrow down the list of candidate SNVs. To solve this, the authors examined data from other sources, including ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1 (a post-translationally modified histone protein found in transcriptionally active genome regions, including enhancers and promoters). Data produced from ChIP-Seq analysis are frequently published in BED, BigBed or similar formats, which can be used directly by SnpEff by adding the -interval command line option. This command line option can be used to add annotations using ChIP-Seq experiments from the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects: since multiple -interval options are allowed in each command line, it is a simple way to combine several annotations: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar \\ -v \\ -motif \\ -interval protocols/ex2_regulatory.bed \\ GRCh37.75 \\ protocols/ex2.vcf \\ > protocols/ex2.ann.vcf In the output VCF file, variants intersecting genomic regions from the -interval command line option are annotated as \"CUSTOM[ex2_regulatory]\" : the name in brackets identifies the file name provided to distinguish multiple annotation files.","title":"Step 2.

This syntax is described in detail in the online manual . In this example, our filter results in only two candidate SNPs, one of which was extensively validated in the original study and is assumed to be causative. The principles illustrated in our example for a small set of SNVs can be applied to millions of variants from whole genome sequencing experiments.

Revision \"2.1c\" : Maven project (by Louis Letourneau) Revision \"2.1c\" : Improved Galaxy wrappers (by Peter briggs) Revision \"2.1b\" : Improved RefSeq parsing Revision \"2.1a\" : Multi-thread race condition solved. Note If you are using hg19 , it is recommended to download the latest database (due to improved RefSeq parsing in 2.1b). Added multi-threaded support (command line option '-t'). GenBank support for building databases. See details here . Config file simplified E.Coli database added Galaxy download database option added. Added all ENSEMBL version 66 genomes Database 'download' issue solved. Apparently SourceForge servers were choking on URL that had double slashes, this should not happen. Implemented a workaround. SnpSift GWAS catalog: Annotate using GWAS Catalog . SnpSift: Added 'varType' to annotate variant type (SNP/MNP/INS/DEL), as well as HOM/HET if possible. Faster VCF processing. Version: 2.0.5 (2011-11-25). Support for RARE amino acids (see details here ) Database for Soybean (Glycine max) added Version: 2.0.5 (2011-11-25). Database download command, e.g. \"java -jar snpEff.jar download GRCH37.64\" Added all ENSEMBL version 65 genomes RefSeq annotations support added. Rogue transcript filter: By default SnpEff filters out some suspicious transcripts from annotations databases. This should improve false positive rates. Amino acid changes in HGVS style (VCF output) Optimized parsing for VCF files with large number of samples (genotypes). Option to suppress summary calculation ('-noStats'), can speed up processing considerably in cases where VCF files have hundreds or thousands of genotype fields. Option '-onlyCoding' is set to 'auto' to reduce number of false positives (see next). Option '-onlyCoding' can be assigne a value: If value is 'true', report only 'protein_coding' transcripts as protein coding changes. If 'false', report all transcript as if they were conding. Default: Auto, i.e. if transcripts any marked as 'protein_coding' the set it to 'true', if no transcripts are marked as 'protein_coding' then set it to 'false'. Added BED output format. This is usefull to annotate the output of a Chip-Seq experiment (e.g. after performing peak calling with MACS, you want to know where the peaks hit). Added BED Annotation output format. This is usefull to get all annotation intervals that intersect a set of variants (or genomic regions). SnpSift filter : Added generic index ('*') for variables, genotypes and effects. E.g.: ( 'GEN[*].GT = '1|1' ) Added support for 'EFF' and subfields (from SnpEff processed files). E.g.: ( EFF[*].EFFECT = 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING' ) SnpSift intidx : Designed to extract a small number of intervals from huge VCF files. Added indexing using memory mapped I/O files for retrieving intervals from huge VCF files. Works really fast! Version: 2.0.3 (2011-10-08) Functional classes added in VCF output (i.e. NONE, SILENT, MISSENSE, NONSENSE) Added MODIFIER effect 'impact'. Rice genome added. Added all ENSEMBL version 64 genomes. Several minor issues solved. Report usage statistics to server (can be disabled using '-noLog' options). Version: 2.0.2 (2011-09-09) VCF output format GATK integration. Now you can use SnpEff from GATK's VariantAnnotator . Default input file is STDIN. I.e. inputFile parameter can be ommited now. Gene list outputs to a TXT file (tab separated) instead of the summary (HTML) file. Command line format changed for various options Option '-sort' deprecated. Version: 1.9.6 (2011-08-08) Ensembl genomes v63 added. Warning!

Default: Auto, i.e. if transcripts any marked as 'protein_coding' the set it to 'true', if no transcripts are marked as 'protein_coding' then set it to 'false'. Added BED output format. This is usefull to annotate the output of a Chip-Seq experiment (e.g. after performing peak calling with MACS, you want to know where the peaks hit). Added BED Annotation output format. This is usefull to get all annotation intervals that intersect a set of variants (or genomic regions). SnpSift filter : Added generic index ('*') for variables, genotypes and effects. E.g.: ( 'GEN[*].GT = '1|1' ) Added support for 'EFF' and subfields (from SnpEff processed files). E.g.: ( EFF[*].EFFECT = 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING' ) SnpSift intidx : Designed to extract a small number of intervals from huge VCF files. Added indexing using memory mapped I/O files for retrieving intervals from huge VCF files. Works really fast! Version: 2.0.3 (2011-10-08) Functional classes added in VCF output (i.e. NONE, SILENT, MISSENSE, NONSENSE) Added MODIFIER effect 'impact'. Rice genome added. Added all ENSEMBL version 64 genomes. Several minor issues solved. Report usage statistics to server (can be disabled using '-noLog' options). Version: 2.0.2 (2011-09-09) VCF output format GATK integration. Now you can use SnpEff from GATK's VariantAnnotator . Default input file is STDIN. I.e. inputFile parameter can be ommited now. Gene list outputs to a TXT file (tab separated) instead of the summary (HTML) file. Command line format changed for various options Option '-sort' deprecated. Version: 1.9.6 (2011-08-08) Ensembl genomes v63 added. Warning!

Epigenome Epigenome Roadmap Project has produced large amounts of information that can be used by SnpEff. Epigenome Roadmap Project goal is \"to map DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and small RNA transcripts in stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in human disease\". A data matrix shows the experimental set ups currently available. Unfortunately the project is not (currently) providing results files that can be used directly by annotation software, such as SnpEff. They will be available later in the project. So, for the time being, data has to be downloaded an pre-processed. We'll be processing these information and making it available (as SnpEff databases) as soon as we can. The latest Epigenome project processed information, can be found here . This includes genomic intervals for high confidence peaks in form of BED files.

There are pre-built databases for over 2,500 genomes, so chances are that your organism of choice already has a SnpEff database available. In the (unlikely?) event that you need to build one yourself, here we describe how to it. Info You can know which genomes are supported by running the following command: $ java -jar snpEff.jar databases Warning Most people do NOT need to build a database, and can safely use a pre-built one. So unless you are working with an rare genome you most likely don't need to do it either. Warning Again, chances are that you DO NOT NEED to build a database. Sorry to repeat this, but I cannot tell how many times I get emails asking for help to build database that is already available. Managing SnpEff databases manually SnpEff databases for the most popular genomes are already pre-built and available for you to download. So, chances are that you don't need to build a database yourself (this will save you a LOT of work). Warning By default SnpEff automatically downloads and installs the database for you, so you don't need to do it manually. The following instructions are for people that want to pre-install databases manually (again, most people don't need to do this). The easiest way to download and install a pre-built SnpEff database manually, is using the download command. E.g. if you want to install the SnpEff database for the human genome, you can run the following command: $ java -jar snpEff.jar download -v GRCh37.75 Info If you are running SnpEff from a directory different than the one it was installed, you will have to specify where the config file is. This is done using the -c command line option: $ java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar download -c path/to/snpEff/snpEff.config -v GRCh37.75 Building a database In order to build a database for a new genome, you need to: Warning Most people do NOT need to build a database, and can safely use a pre-built one. So unless you are working with a rare genome you most likely don't need to do it either. Configure a new genome in SnpEff's config file snpEff.config . Add genome entry to snpEff's configuration If the genome uses a non-standard codon table: Add codon table parameter Get the reference genome sequence (e.g. in FASTA format). Get genome annotations. There are four different ways you can do this: Option 1: Building a database from GTF files (the easiest way) Option 2: Building a database from GFF files Option 3: Building a database from RefSeq table from UCSC Option 4: Building a database from GenBank files Run a command to create the database (i.e. java -jar snpEff.jar build ... \"`) Note: All files can be compressed using gzip. E.g. the reference file 'hg19.fa' can be compressed to 'hg19.fa.gz', snpEff will automatically decompress the file. Warning Some files claimed to be compressed using GZIP are actually not or even use a block compression variant not supported by Java's gzip library. If you notice that your build process finishes abruptly for no apparent reason, try uncompressing the files. This sometimes happens with ENSEMBL files. Configuring a new genome In order to tell SnpEff that there is a new genome available, you must update SnpEff's configuration file snpEff.config . You must add a new genome entry to snpEff.config . If your genome, or a chromosome, uses non-standard codon tables you must update snpEff.config accordingly. A typical case is when you use mitochondrial DNA. Then you specify that chromosome 'MT' uses codon.Invertebrate_Mitochondrial codon table. Another common case is when you are adding a bacterial genome, then you specify that the codon table is Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid . Add a genome to the configuration file This example shows how to add a new genome to the config files. For this example we'll use the mouse genome (mm37.61): Edit the config file to create the new genome: vi snpEffect.config Add the following lines (you are editing snpEffect.config): # Mouse genome, version mm37.61 mm37.61.genome : Mouse Warning You may need to add codon table information for the genome or some parts of it (e.g. mitochondrial \"chromosome\"). See next section for details. Optional: Add genome to Galaxy's menu: cd /path/to/galaxy cd tools/snpEffect/ vi snpEffect.xml Add the following lines to the file: <param name=\"genomeVersion\" type=\"select\" label=\"Genome\"> <option value=\"hg37\">Human (hg37)<option> <option value=\"mm37.61\">Mouse (mm37.61)<option> <param> Configuring codon tables (not always required) Codon tables are provided in the snpEff.config configuration file under the section codon.Name_of_your_codon_table . The format is a comma separated list of CODON/AMINO_ACID . E.g.: codon.Invertebrate_Mitochondrial: TTT/F, TTC/F, TAC/Y, TAA/*, ATG/M+, ATG/M+, ACT/T, ... Note that codons marked with '*' are STOP codons and codons marked with a '+' are START codons. In order for you to use them, you have to specify that a given \"chromosome\" uses one of the tables (otherwise the default codon table is used). E.g. Here we say the chromosome 'M' from fly genome (dm3) uses Invertebrate_Mitochondrial codon table: dm3.M.codonTable : Invertebrate_Mitochondrial ...of course, chromosome 'M' is not a real chromosome, it is just a way to mark the sequence as mitochondrial DNA in the reference genome. Reference genome: GTF, GFF, RefSeq or GenBank As we previously mentioned, reference genome information can be in different formats: GTF, GFF, RefSeq or GenBank. In the following sub-sections, we show how to build a database for each type of genomic information file. Option 1: Building a database from GTF files GTF 2.2 files are supported by SnpEff (e.g. ENSEMBL releases genome annotations in this format). Get the genome and uncompress it: # Create directory for this new genome cd /path/to/snpEff/data/ mkdir mm37.61 cd mm37.61 # Get annotation files wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.gtf.gz mv Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.gtf.gz genes.gtf.gz # Get the genome cd /path/to/snpEff/data/genomes wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.dna.toplevel.fa.gz mv Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.dna.toplevel.fa.gz mm37.61.fa.gz Note: The FASTA file can be either in /path/to/snpEff/data/genomes/mm37.61.fa or in /path/to/snpEff/data/mm37.61/sequences.fa Add the new genome to the config file (see Add a new genome to the configuration file for details) Create database: cd /path/to/snpEff java -jar snpEff.jar build -gtf22 -v mm37.61 Option 2: Building a database from GFF files Warning Using GFF is discouraged, we recommend you use GTF files instead (whenever possible). This example shows how to create a database for a new genome using GFF file ((e.g. FlyBase, WormBase, BeeBase release GFF files). For this example we'll use the Drosophila melanogaster genome (dm5.31): Get a GFF file (into path/to/snpEff/data/dm5.31/genes.gff): mkdir path/to/snpEff/data/dm5.31 cd path/to/snpEff/data/dm5.31 wget ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r5.31_FB2010_08/gff/dmel-all-r5.31.gff.gz mv dmel-all-r5.31.gff.gz genes.gff.gz Note: GFF3 files can include the reference sequence in the same file. This is done by dumping the fasta file after a '##FASTA' line. You can also add the sequence fasta file to the 'data/genomes/' directory, like it is done in when using GTF format. Add the new genome to the config file (see Add a new genome to the configuration file for details) Create database (note the \"-gff3\" flag): cd /path/to/snpEff java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v dm5.31 Option 3: Building a database from RefSeq table from UCSC This example shows how to create a database for a new genome. For this example we'll use the Human genome (hg19). Warning Using UCSC genome tables is highly discouraged, we recommend you use ENSEMBL versions instead. Warning UCSC tables sometimes change for different species. This means that even if these instructions work for human genome, it might not work for other genomes. Obviously creating a new parser for each genome is impractical, so working with UCSC genomes is highly discouraged. We recommend to use ENSEMBL genomes instead. Warning UCSC genomes provide only major release version, but NOT sub-versions. E.g. UCSC's \"hg19\" has major version 19 but there is no \"sub-version\", whereas ENSEMBL's GRCh37.70 clearly has major version 37 and minor version 70. Not providing a minor version means that they might change the database and two \"hg19\" genomes are actually be different. This creates all sorts of consistency problems (e.g. the annotations may not be the same that you see in the UCSC genome browser, even though both of them are 'hg19' version). Using UCSC genome tables is highly discouraged, we recommend you use ENSEMBL versions instead. In order to build a genome using UCSC tables, you can follow these instructions: Go to UCSC genome browser Click on \"Table\" menu Select parameters as shown here: Click on \"get output\" and save the data to file \"/path/to/snpEff/data/hg19/genes.refseq\". Add the fasta reference genome. The FASTA file can be either in: /path/to/snpEff/data/genomes/hg19.fa or in: /path/to/snpEff/data/hg19/sequences.fa Add the new genome to the config file (see Add a new genome to the configuration file for details) Create database (note the -refSeq flag): cd /path/to/snpEff java -jar snpEff.jar build -refSeq -v hg19 Option 4: Building a database from GenBank files This example shows how to create a database for a new genome. For this example we'll use \"Staphylococcus aureus\": Go to NIH page for CP000730 Download the features in geneBank format, by clicking as shown in the following images (red arrows): Make sure you click the \"Update\" button! Then you go to the \"Send\" menu: and then: Save the GenBank data to \"/path/to/snpEff/data/CP000730/genes.gbk\". Note: If there are more than one genbank file for an organism (e.g. multiple chromosomes), then you can download each file and concatenate them. E.g.: Vibrio Cholerae has two chromosomes with GenBank accessions: NC_002505.1 and NC_002506.1. You can download both files and save them as snpEff/data/vibrio/NC_002505.1.gbk and snpEff/data/vibrio/NC_002506.1.gbk respectively, and then concatenate both files: cat NC_002505.1.gbk NC_002506.1.gbk > genes.gbk Add the following entries in the config file: # Vibrio Cholerae vibrio.genome : Vibrio Cholerae vibrio.chromosomes : NC_002505.1, NC_002506.1 vibrio.NC_002505.1.codonTable : Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid vibrio.NC_002506.1.codonTable : Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid Create database (note the -genbank flag): cd /path/to/snpEff java -jar snpEff.jar build -genbank -v CP000730 Example: Building the Human Genome database This is a full example on how to build the human genome database (using GTF file from ENSEBML), it includes support for regulatory features, sanity check, rare amino acids, etc.. # Go to SnpEff's install dir cd ~/snpeff # Create database dir mkdir data/GRCh37.70 cd data/GRCh37.70 # Download annotated genes wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-70/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.gtf.gz mv Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.gtf.gz genes.gtf.gz # Download proteins # This is used for: # - \"Rare Amino Acid\" annotations # - Sanity check (checking protein predicted from DNA sequences match 'real' proteins) wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-70/fasta/homo_sapiens/pep/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.pep.all.fa.gz mv Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.pep.all.fa.gz protein.fa.gz # Download CDSs # Note: This is used as \"sanity check\" (checking that CDSs predicted from gene sequences match 'real' CDSs) wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-70/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.cdna.all.fa.gz mv Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.cdna.all.fa.gz cds.fa.gz # Download regulatory annotations wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-70/regulation/homo_sapiens/AnnotatedFeatures.gff.gz mv AnnotatedFeatures.gff.gz regulation.gff.gz # Uncompress gunzip *.gz # Download genome cd ../genomes/ wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-70/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.dna.toplevel.fa.gz mv Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.70.dna.toplevel.fa.gz GRCh37.70.fa.gz # Uncompress: # Why do we need to uncompress? # Because ENSEMBL compresses files using a block compress gzip which is not compatible with Java's library Gunzip gunzip GRCh37.70.fa.gz # Edit snpEff.config file # # WARNING!

Make sure chromosome names are consistent in all the files you use. When I build the database using GFF 3 SnpEff reports that Exons don't have sequences GFF3 files can have sequence information either in the same file or in a separate fasta file. In order to add sequence information in the GFF file, you can do this: cat annotations.gff > genes.gff echo \"###\" >> genes.gff echo \"##FASTA\" >> genes.gff cat sequence.fa >> genes.gff When building a database, I get zero protein coding genes When building a database, snpEff tries to find which transcripts are protein coding. This is done using the 'bioType' information. The bioType information is not a standard GFF or GTF feature. So I follow ENSEMBL's convention of using the second column ('source') for bioType, as well as the gene_biotype attribute. If your file was not produced by ENSEMBL, it probably doesn't have this information. This means that snpEff doesn't know which genes are protein coding and which ones are not. Having no information, snpEff will treat all genes as protein coding (assuming you have -treatAllAsProteinCoding Auto option in the command line, which is the default). So you will get effects as if all genes were protein coding, then you can filter out the irrelevant genes. Unfortunately, this is the best I can do if there is no 'bioType' information When building a database, I get too many warnings There are plenty of GFF and GTF files that, unfortunately, do not follow the specification. SnpEff usually complains about this, but tries hard to correct the problems. So the database may be OK even after you see many warnings. You can check the database to see if the features (genes, exons, UTRs) have been correctly incorporated, by taking a look at the database: java -jar snpEff.jar dump myGenome | less","title":"Building databases"},{"location":"se_buildingdb/#building-databases","text":"SnpEff needs a database to perform genomic annotations.

Single multi-sample VCF vs. multiple VCF files. It is common practice, to have all samples in a single \"multi-sample VCF file\" (having two or more separate VCF files is highly discouraged). This is also the \"gold standard\" in cancer analysis standard, so all samples (both somatic and germline) should be in one VCF file. SnpEff requires that you follow gold standard practices, thus requires a single multi-sample VCF (it is not possible to run cancer analysis using multiple VCF files). Running in cancer analysis mode Using the -cancer command line option, you can compare somatic vs germline samples. So an example command line would be: $ java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v -cancer GRCh37.75 cancer.vcf > cancer.ann.vcf Representing cancer data In a typical cancer sequencing experiment, we want to measure and annotate differences between germline (healthy) and somatic (cancer) tissue samples from the same patient. The complication is that germline is not always the same as the reference genome, so a typical annotation does not work. For instance, let's assume that at a given genomic position (e.g. chr1:69091), reference genome is 'A', germline is 'C' and somatic is 'G'. This should be represented in a VCF file as: #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT Patient_01_Germline Patient_01_Somatic 1 69091 . A C,G . PASS AC=1 GT 1/0 2/1 Warning Some people tend to represent this by changing REF base 'A' using germline 'C'. This is a mistake, REF must always represent the reference genome, not one of your samples. Under normal conditions, SnpEff would provide the effects of changes \"A -> C\" and \"A -> G\". But in case of cancer samples, we are actually interested in the difference between somatic and germline, so we'd like to calculate the effect of a \"C -> G\" mutation. Calculating this effect is not trivial, since we have to build a new \"reference\" by calculating the effect of the first mutation (\"A -> C\") and then calculate the effect of the second one (\"C -> G\") on our \"new reference\". Info In order to activate cancer analysis, you must use -cancer command line option. Defining cancer samples As we already mentioned, cancer data is represented in a VCF file using multiple ALTs (REF field always is reference genome). In order to specify which samples are somatic and which ones are germline, there are two options: Use a TXT file using -cancerSamples command line option. Use the PEDIGREE meta information in your VCF file's header. This is the default, but some people might find hard to edit / change information in VCF file's headers. Warning If you do not provide either PEDIGREE meta information or a TXT samples file, SnpEff will not know which somatic samples derive from which germline samples. Thus it will be unable to perform cancer effect analysis. TXT file This is quite easy. All you have to do is to create a tab-separated TXT file having two columns: the first column has the germline sample names and the second column has the somatic sample names. Make sure that sample names match exactly the ones in the VCF file. E.g.: Create a TXT file named 'samples_cancer.txt' Patient_01_Germline Patient_01_Somatic Patient_02_Germline Patient_02_Somatic Patient_03_Germline Patient_03_Somatic Patient_04_Germline Patient_04_Somatic Then you have to specify this TXT file when invoking SnpEff, using the -cancerSamples command line option. E.g. In our example, the file name is 'samples_cancer.txt', so the command line would look like this: $ cat examples/samples_cancer_one.txt Patient_01_Germline Patient_01_Somatic $ java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v \\ -cancer \\ -cancerSamples examples/samples_cancer_one.txt \\ GRCh37.75 \\ examples/cancer.vcf \\ > cancer.ann.vcf VCF header This is the default method and the main advantage is that you don't have to carry information on a separate TXT file (all the information is within your VCF file). You have to add the PEDIGREE header with the appropriate information to your VCF file. Obviously this requires you to edit you VCF file's header. Warning How to edit VCF headers is beyond the scope of this manual (we recommend using vcf-annotate from VCFtools ). But if you find adding PEDIGREE information to your VCF file difficult, just use the TXT file method described in the previous sub-section. E.g.: Pedigree information in a VCF file would look like this: $ cat examples/cancer_pedigree.vcf ##PEDIGREE=<Derived=Patient_01_Somatic,Original=Patient_01_Germline> #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT Patient_01_Germline Patient_01_Somatic 1 69091 .

PASS AF=0.3580 GT 1/1 2/2 $ java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v -cancer GRCh37.75 examples/cancer_pedigree.vcf > examples/cancer_pedigree.ann.vcf Here we say that the sample called Patient_01_Somatic is derived from the sample called Patient_01_Germline . In this context, this means that cancer sample is derived from the healthy tissue. Interpreting Cancer annotations Interpretation of ANN field cancer sample relies on 'Allele' sub-field. Just as a reminder, ANN field has the following format: ANN = Allele | Annotation | Annotation_Impact | Gene_Name | Gene_ID | Feature_Type | Feature_ID | Transcript_BioType | Rank | HGVS.c | HGVS.p | cDNA.pos / cDNA.length | CDS.pos / CDS.length | AA.pos / AA.length | Distance | ERRORS_WARNINGS_INFO The Allele field tells you which effect relates to which genotype. More importantly, genotype difference between Somatic and Germline. Example: when there are multiple ALTs (e.g. REF='A' ALT='C,G') and the genotype field says: Allele = \"C\": it means is the effect related to the first ALT ('C') Allele = \"G\" if it's the effect related to the second ALT ('G') Allele = \"G-C\" means that this is the effect of having the second ALT as variant while using the first ALT as reference (\"C -> G\"). It is important that you understand the meaning of the last one, because you'll use it often for your cancer analysis. Example: Sample output for the previously mentioned VCF example would be (the output has been edited for readability reasons) For the first line we get (edited for readability): $ java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v -cancer -cancerSamples examples/samples_cancer_one.txt GRCh37.75 examples/cancer.vcf > examples/cancer.eff.vcf 1 69091 .

Finally, this is what you were expecting for, the cancer comparisons. Since both germline and somatic are heterozygous (GT are '1/0' and '2/1'), there are 4 possible comparisons to make: G vs C : This is the Somatic vs Germline we are interested in. SnpEff reports this one G vs A : This compares ALT to REF, so it was already reported in \"default mode\". SnpEff doesn't report this one again.

Warning Some features are not available when running in multithreaded mode. For instance, statistics are disabled in order to speed up the annotation process. Warning In multithreaded mode, SnpEff will attempt to use all available cores. Nevertheless is very rare that all cores get 100% usage. HGVS /Classic notation SnpEff uses HGVS notation , which is somewhat popular amongst clinicians. You can de-activate HGVS notation (to use the old annotation style) using the command line option -classic . Logging SnpEff will try to log usage statistics to our \"log server\". This is useful for us to understand user's needs and have some statistics on what users are doing with the program (e.g. decide whether a command or option is useful or not). Logging can be deactivated by using the -noLog command line option. Filters SnpEff supports filter of output results by using combinations of the following command line options: Warning Output filters can be implemented using SnpSift filter , which allows to create more flexible and complex filters. Command line option Meaning -no-downstream Do not show DOWNSTREAM changes -no-intergenic Do not show INTERGENIC changes -no-intron Do not show INTRON changes -no-upstream Do not show UPSTREAM changes -no-utr Do not show 5_PRIME_UTR or 3_PRIME_UTR changes -no EffectType Do not show 'EffectType' (it can be used several times) e.g: -no INTERGENIC -no SPLICE_SITE_REGION Annotating selected intervals You can use the -fi intervals.bed command line option (filterInterval). For instance, let's assume you have an interval file 'intervals.bed': 2L 10000 10999 2L 12000 12999 2L 14000 14999 2L 16000 16999 2L 18000 18999 In order to get only variants matching your intervals, you can use the command: $ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -fi intervals.bed GRCh38.76 test.chr22.vcf Canonical transcripts SnpEff allows to annotate using canonical transcripts by using -canon command line option. Warning Canonical transcripts are defined as the longest CDS of amongst the protein coding transcripts in a gene. If none of the transcripts in a gene is protein coding, then it is the longest cDNA. Warning Although this seems to be the standard definitions of \"canonical transcript\", there is no warranties that what SnpEff considers a canonical transcript will match exactly what UCSC or ENSEMBL consider a canonical transcript. Example on how to use canonical transcripts annotations: $ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -v -canon GRCh37.75 examples/test.chr22.vcf > file.ann.canon.vcf In order to get a list of canonical transcripts, you can use the -d (debug) command line option. E.g.: $ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -d -v -canon GRCh37.75 test.vcf 00:00:00.000 Reading configuration file 'snpEff.config' 00:00:00.173 done 00:00:00.173 Reading database for genome version 'GRCh37.66' 00:00:02.834 done 00:00:02.845 Filtering out non-canonical transcripts. 00:00:03.219 Canonical transcripts: geneName geneId transcriptId cdsLength GGPS1 ENSG00000152904 ENST00000488594 903 RP11-628K18.1.1 ENSG00000235112 ENST00000430808 296 MIPEPP2 ENSG00000224783 ENST00000422560 1819 FEN1P1 ENSG00000215873 ENST00000401028 1145 AL591704.7.1 ENSG00000224784 ENST00000421658 202 CAPNS1P1 ENSG00000215874 ENST00000401029 634 ST13P20 ENSG00000215875 ENST00000447996 1061 NCDN ENSG00000020129 ENST00000373243 2190 RP11-99H8.1.1 ENSG00000226208 ENST00000423187 432 AL391001.1 ENSG00000242652 ENST00000489859 289 ... Selected list of transcripts SnpEff allows you to provide a list of transcripts to use for annotations by using the -onlyTr file.txt and providing a file with one transcript ID per line. Any other transcript will be ignored. $ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -onlyTr my_transcripts.txt GRCh37.75 test.chr22.vcf > test.chr22.ann.vcf Upstream and downstream You can change the default upstream and downstream interval size (default is 5K) using the -ud size_in_bases option. This also allows to eliminate any upstream and downstream effect by using \"-ud 0\". Example: Make upstream and downstream size zero (i.e. do not report any upstream or downstream effect). $ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -ud 0 GRCh37.75 test.chr22.vcf > test.chr22.ann.vcf Splice site size You can change the default splice site size (default is 2 bases) using the -spliceSiteSize size_in_bases option. Example: Make splice sites four bases long $ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -spliceSiteSize 4 GRCh37.75 test.chr22.vcf > test.chr22.ann.vcf Adding your own annotations SnpEff allows user defined intervals to be annotated. This is achieved using the -interval file.bed command line option, which can be used multiple times in the same command line (it accepts files in TXT, BED, BigBed, VCF, GFF formats). Any variant that intersects an interval defined in those files, will be annotated using the \"name\" field (fourth column) in the input bed file. Example: We create our own annotations in my_annotations.bed $ cat my_annotations.bed 1 10000 20000 MY_ANNOTATION $ cat test.vcf 1 10469 .

The input can also be a BED file, the output file has the same information as CLOSEST info field, added to the fourth column of the output BED file: $ snpeff closest -bed GRCh37.66 test.bed 1 12077 12078 line_1;0,exon_1_11869_12227,ENST00000456328,DDX11L1 1 16096 16097 line_2;150,exon_1_15796_15947,ENST00000423562,WASH7P 1 40260 40261 line_3;4180,exon_1_35721_36081,ENST00000417324,FAM138A 1 63879 63880 line_4;0,exon_1_62948_63887,ENST00000492842,OR4G11P SnpEff count As the name suggests, snpEff count command counts how many reads and bases from a BAM file hit a gene, transcript, exon, intron, etc. Input files can be in BAM, SAM, VCF, BED or BigBed formats. A summary HTML file with charts is generated. Here are some examples: If you need to count how many reads (and bases) from a BAM file hit each genomic region, you can use 'count' utility. The command line is quite simple. E.g. in order to count how many reads (from N BAM files) hit regions of the human genome, you simply run: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar count GRCh37.68 readsFile_1.bam readsFile_2.bam ... readsFile_N.bam > countReads.txt The output is a TXT (tab-separated) file, that looks like this: chr start end type IDs Reads:readsFile_1.bam Bases:readsFile_1.bam Reads:readsFile_2.bam Bases:readsFile_2.bam ... 1 1 11873 Intergenic DDX11L1 130 6631 50 2544 1 1 249250621 Chromosome 1 2527754 251120400 2969569 328173439 1 6874 11873 Upstream NR_046018;DDX11L1 130 6631 50 2544 1 9362 14361 Downstream NR_024540;WASH7P 243 13702 182 9279 1 11874 12227 Exon exon_1;NR_046018;DDX11L1 4 116 2 102 1 11874 14408 Gene DDX11L1 114 7121 135 6792 1 11874 14408 Transcript NR_046018;DDX11L1 114 7121 135 6792 1 12228 12229 SpliceSiteDonor exon_1;NR_046018;DDX11L1 3 6 0 0 1 12228 12612 Intron intron_1;NR_046018;DDX11L1 13 649 0 0 1 12611 12612 SpliceSiteAcceptor exon_2;NR_046018;DDX11L1 0 0 0 0 1 12613 12721 Exon exon_2;NR_046018;DDX11L1 3 24 1 51 1 12722 12723 SpliceSiteDonor exon_2;NR_046018;DDX11L1 3 6 0 0 1 12722 13220 Intron intron_2;NR_046018;DDX11L1 22 2110 20 987 1 13219 13220 SpliceSiteAcceptor exon_3;NR_046018;DDX11L1 5 10 1 2 1 13221 14408 Exon exon_3;NR_046018;DDX11L1 82 4222 113 5652 1 14362 14829 Exon exon_11;NR_024540;WASH7P 37 1830 7 357 1 14362 29370 Transcript NR_024540;WASH7P 704 37262 524 34377 1 14362 29370 Gene WASH7P 704 37262 524 34377 1 14409 19408 Downstream NR_046018;DDX11L1 122 7633 39 4254 The columns are: Column 1: Chromosome name Column 2: Genomic region start Column 3: Genomic region end Column 4: Genomic region type (e.g. Exon, Gene, SpliceSiteDonor, etc.) Column 5: ID (e.g. exon ID ; transcript ID; gene ID) Column 6: Count of reads (in file readsFile_1.bam) intersecting genomic region.

They calculate CDS and protein sequences from a SnpEff database and then compare the results to a FASTA file (having the \"correct\" sequences). The commands are invoked automatically when building databases, so there is no need for the user to invoke them manually. SnpEff len Calculates the genomic length of every type of marker (Gene, Exon, Utr, etc.). Length is calculated by overlapping all markers and counting the number of bases (e.g. a base is counted as 'Exon' if any exon falls onto that base). This command also reports the probability of a Binomial model. Info Parameter -r num adjusts the model for a read length of 'num' bases. That is, if two markers of the same type are closer than 'num' bases, it joins them by inclining the bases separating them.

Note: It requires R. Example: Extract the file sizes in a directory and show a histogram $ ls -al scripts/ | tr -s \" \" | cut -f 5 -d \" \" | ./scripts/hist.pl Creates the following plot: plotMA.pl, plot.pl, plotQQ.pl, plotSmoothScatter.pl Similar to 'hist.pl', these perform plots based on input from STDIN. Note that in some cases, inputs are expected to be probabilities (qqplot.pl) or pairs of numbers (maPlot.pl). $ ls -al scripts/ | tr -s \" \" | cut -f 5 -d \" \" | ./scripts/plot.pl Creates the following plot: queue.pl Process a list of statements in parallel according to the number of CPUs available in the local machine. splitChr.pl Splits a file by chromosome. Works on any tab separated file that the first column is CHR field (e.g. BED, VCF, etc.) Example: $ cat large_test.vcf | ./scripts/splitChr.pl Input line 28.

Here we describe supported input data formats. VCF files As we mentioned before, Variant Call Format (VCF) is the recommended format for input files. This is the format used by the \"1000 Genomes Project\", and is currently considered the de facto standard for genomic variants. It is also the default format used in SnpEff. In a nutshell, VCF format is tab-separated text file having the following columns: Chromosome name Position Variant's ID Reference genome Alternative (i.e. variant) Quality score Filter (whether or not the variant passed quality filters) INFO : Generic information about this variant. SnpEff adds annotation information in this column. Here is an example of a few lines in a VCF file: #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 20 14370 rs6054257 G A 29 PASS NS=3;DP=14;AF=0.5;DB;H2 20 17330 . T A 3 q10 NS=3;DP=11;AF=0.017 Note that the first line is header information. Header lines start with '#' VCF output As we mentioned in the previous chapter, VCF is SnpEff's default input and output format. It is highly recommended to use VCF as input and output format, since it is a standard format that can be also used by other tools and software packages. Thus VCF makes it much easier to integrate genomic data processing pipelines. SnpEff adds annotation information to the INFO field of a VCF file. The INFO field is the eight column of a VCF file, see previous section for a quick example or take a look at the VCF specification for details. Here is an example of a file before and after being annotated using SnpEff: VCF file before annotations #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 1 889455 . G A 100.0 PASS AF=0.0005 1 897062 . C T 100.0 PASS AF=0.0005 VCF file after being annotated using SnpEff #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 1 889455 . G A 100.0 PASS AF=0.0005;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|Cag/Tag|Q236*|749|NOC2L||CODING|NM_015658|) 1 897062 . C T 100.0 PASS AF=0.0005;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|Cag/Tag|Q141*|642|KLHL17||CODING|NM_198317|) A you can see, SnpEff added an 'EFF' tag to the INFO field (eight column). VCF Header lines SnpEff updates the header of the VCF file to reflect additional fields. This is required by the VCF specification. SnpEff also adds the command line options used to annotate the file as well as SnpEff's version, so you can keep track of what exactly was done. Here is an example of some header lines added to an annotated file: ##SnpEffVersion=\"SnpEff 3.1m (build 2013-02-08)\" ##SnpEffCmd=\"SnpEff hg19 demo.1kg.vcf \" ##INFO=<ID=EFF,Number=.,Type=String,Description=\"Predicted effects for this variant.Format: 'Effect ( Effect_Impact | Functional_Class | Codon_Change | Amino_Acid_change| Amino_Acid_length | Gene_Name | Gene_BioType | Coding | Transcript | Exon [ | ERRORS | WARNINGS ] )' \\\"> ANN field (VCF output files) Functional annotations information is added to the INFO field using an ANN tag.

E.g.: # CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO chr1 123456 . C A . . ANN=A|... chr1 234567 . A G,T . . ANN=G|... , T|... In case of cancer sample, when comparing somatic versus germline using a non-standard reference (e.g. one of the ALTs is the reference) the format should be ALT-REFERENCE. E.g.: #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO chr1 123456 . A C,G . . ANN=G-C|... Compound variants: two or more variants affecting the annotations (e.g. two consecutive SNPs conforming a MNP, two consecutive frame_shift variants that \"recover\" the frame). In this case, the Allele field should include a reference to the other variant/s included in the annotation: #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO chr1 123456 . A T . . ANN=T|... chr1 123457 . C G . . ANN=C-chr1:123456_A>T|... Annotation (a.k.a. effect): Annotated using Sequence Ontology terms. Multiple effects can be concatenated using '&'. #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO chr1 123456 . C A . . ANN=A|intron_variant&nc_transcript_variant|... Putative_impact: A simple estimation of putative impact / deleteriousness : {HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, MODIFIER} Gene Name: Common gene name (HGNC). Optional: use closest gene when the variant is \"intergenic\". Gene ID: Gene ID Feature type: Which type of feature is in the next field (e.g. transcript, motif, miRNA, etc.). It is preferred to use Sequence Ontology (SO) terms, but 'custom' (user defined) are allowed. ANN=A|stop_gained|HIGH|||transcript|... Tissue specific features may include cell type / tissue information separated by semicolon e.g.: ANN=A|histone_binding_site|LOW|||H3K4me3:HeLa-S3| Feature ID: Depending on the annotation, this may be: Transcript ID (preferably using version number), Motif ID, miRNA, ChipSeq peak, Histone mark, etc. Note: Some features may not have ID (e.g. histone marks from custom Chip-Seq experiments may not have a unique ID). Transcript biotype: The bare minimum is at least a description on whether the transcript is {\"Coding\", \"Noncoding\"}. Whenever possible, use ENSEMBL biotypes. Rank / total: Exon or Intron rank / total number of exons or introns. HGVS.c: Variant using HGVS notation (DNA level) HGVS.p: If variant is coding, this field describes the variant using HGVS notation (Protein level). Since transcript ID is already mentioned in 'feature ID', it may be omitted here. cDNA_position / cDNA_len: Position in cDNA and trancript's cDNA length (one based). CDS_position / CDS_len: Position and number of coding bases (one based includes START and STOP codons). Protein_position / Protein_len: Position and number of AA (one based, including START, but not STOP). Distance to feature: All items in this field are options, so the field could be empty. Up/Downstream: Distance to first / last codon Intergenic: Distance to closest gene Distance to closest Intron boundary in exon (+/- up/downstream). If same, use positive number. Distance to closest exon boundary in Intron (+/- up/downstream) Distance to first base in MOTIF Distance to first base in miRNA Distance to exon-intron boundary in splice_site or splice _region ChipSeq peak: Distance to summit (or peak center) Histone mark / Histone state: Distance to summit (or peak center) Errors, Warnings or Information messages: Add errors, warnings or informative message that can affect annotation accuracy. It can be added using either 'codes' (as shown in column 1, e.g. W1) or 'message types' (as shown in column 2, e.g. WARNING_REF_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GENOME). All these errors, warnings or information messages messages are optional. Code Message type Description / Notes E1 ERROR_CHROMOSOME_NOT_FOUND Chromosome does not exists in reference genome database. Typically indicates a mismatch between the chromosome names in the input file and the chromosome names used in the reference genome. E2 ERROR_OUT_OF_CHROMOSOME_RANGE The variant's genomic coordinate is greater than chromosome's length. W1 WARNING_REF_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GENOME This means that the 'REF' field in the input VCF file does not match the reference genome. This warning may indicate a conflict between input data and data from reference genome (for instance is the input VCF was aligned to a different reference genome). W2 WARNING_SEQUENCE_NOT_AVAILABLE Reference sequence is not available, thus no inference could be performed. W3 WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_INCOMPLETE A protein coding transcript having a non-multiple of 3 length. It indicates that the reference genome has missing information about this particular transcript. W4 WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_MULTIPLE_STOP_CODONS A protein coding transcript has two or more STOP codons in the middle of the coding sequence (CDS). This should not happen and it usually means the reference genome may have an error in this transcript. W5 WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_NO_START_CODON A protein coding transcript does not have a proper START codon. It is rare that a real transcript does not have a START codon, so this probably indicates an error or missing information in the reference genome. I1 INFO_REALIGN_3_PRIME Variant has been realigned to the most 3-prime position within the transcript. This is usually done to to comply with HGVS specification to always report the most 3-prime annotation. I2 INFO_COMPOUND_ANNOTATION This effect is a result of combining more than one variants (e.g. two consecutive SNPs that conform an MNP, or two consecutive frame_shift variants that compensate frame). I3 INFO_NON_REFERENCE_ANNOTATION An alternative reference sequence was used to calculate this annotation (e.g. cancer sample comparing somatic vs. germline). Consistency between HGVS and functional annotations: In some cases there might be inconsistent reporting between 'annotation' and HGVS. This is due to the fact that VCF recommends aligning to the leftmost coordinate, whereas HGSV recommends aligning to the \"most 3-prime coordinate\". For instance, an InDel on the edge of an exon, which has an 'intronic' annotation according to VCF alignment recommendation, can lead to a 'stop_gained' when aligned using HGVS's recommendation (using the most 3-prime possible alignment). So the 'annotation' sub-field will report 'intron' whereas HGVS sub-field will report a 'stop_gained'. This is obviously inconsistent and must be avoided. In order to report annotations that are consistent with HGVS notation, variants must be re-aligned according to each transcript's strand (i.e. align the variant according to the transcript's most 3-prime coordinate). Then annotations are calculated, thus the reported annotations will be consistent with HGVS notation. Annotation software should have a command line option to override this behaviour (e.g. -no_shift_hgvs ) EFF field (VCF output files) Effects information is added to the INFO field using an 'EFF' tag. Important: This section refers the old annotation format using the 'EFF' tag which can be activated using the -formatEff command line option. As of version 4.1 SnpEff uses the 'ANN' field by default. Notes: As of version 4.0, the default output uses Sequence Ontology for 'Effect' names. You can output \"old\" style effect names by using the -classic command line option. When multiple effects are available, they are sorted first by \"Effect_Impact\", then by \"Effect\" and finally by \"marker's genomic coordinates\" (e.g. affected transcript's genomic coordinates). Staring from version 4.0, SnpEff outputs HGVS notation in the 'AA' sub-field by default. There can be multiple effects separated by comma. The format for each effect is: EFF= Effect ( Effect_Impact | Functional_Class | Codon_Change | Amino_Acid_Change| Amino_Acid_Length | Gene_Name | Transcript_BioType | Gene_Coding | Transcript_ID | Exon_Rank | Genotype_Number [ | ERRORS | WARNINGS ] ) EFF Sub-field Meaning Effect Effect of this variant. See details here . Effect impact Effect impact {High, Moderate, Low, Modifier}. See details here . Functional Class Functional class Codon_Change / Distance Codon change: old_codon/new_codon OR distance to transcript (in case of upstream / downstream) Amino_Acid_Change Amino acid change: old_AA AA_position/new_AA (e.g. 'E30K') Amino_Acid_Length Length of protein in amino acids (actually, transcription length divided by 3). Gene_Name Gene name Transcript_BioType Transcript bioType, if available. Gene_Coding [CODING | NON_CODING] . This field is 'CODING' if any transcript of the gene is marked as protein coding. Transcript_ID Transcript ID (usually ENSEMBL IDs) Exon/Intron Rank Exon rank or Intron rank (e.g. '1' for the first exon, '2' for the second exon, etc.) Genotype_Number Genotype number corresponding to this effect (e.g. '2' if the effect corresponds to the second ALT) Warnings / Errors Any warnings or errors (not shown if empty). Multiple annotations per VCF line Usually there is more than one annotation reported in each ANN (or EFF ) field. There are several reasons for this: A variant can affect multiple genes. E.g a variant can be DOWNSTREAM from one gene and UPSTREAM from another gene. E.g.: In complex organisms, genes usually have multiple transcripts. So SnpEff reports the effect of a variant on each transcript. E.g.: #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 1 889455 . G A . . . In this case SnpEff will report the effect of each variant on each gene and each transcript (output edited for readability): #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 1 889455 . G A . .

E.g. If reference genome is 'G', but the sample has either 'A' or 'T' (non-biallelic variant), then this will be reported as one VCF line, having multiple alternative variants (notice that there are two ALTs): #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 1 889455 . G A,T . . . In this case SnpEff will report the effect of each ALT on each gene and each transcript.

Effect sort order . When multiple effects are reported, SnpEff sorts the effects the following way: Putative impact: Effects having higher putative impact are first. Effect type: Effects assumed to be more deleterious effects first. Canonical transcript before non-canonical. Marker genomic coordinates (e.g. genes starting before first). Effect prediction details Detailed description of the effect predicted by SnpEff in the Effect and Effect_Impact sub-fields. Notes: Effect (Sequence Ontology) Sequence ontology ( SO ) allows to standardize terminology used for assessing sequence changes and impact. This allows for a common language across all variant annotation programs and makes it easier to communicate using a uniform terminology. Starting from version 4.0 VCF output uses SO terms by default. Effect (Classic) This are the \"classic\" effect names usd by SnpEff, these can be accessed using the -classic command line option. Effect impact Effects are categorized by 'impact': {High, Moderate, Low, Modifier}. This are pre-defined categories to help users find more significant variants. Warning Impact categories must be used with care, they were created only to help and simplify the filtering process. Obviously, there is no way to predict whether a \"high impact\" or a \"low impact\" variant is the one producing a phenotype of interest. Here is a list of effects and some brief explanations: Effect Seq. Ontology Effect Classic Note & Example Impact coding_sequence_variant CDS The variant hits a CDS.

Details are provided in the 'feature type' sub-field (ANN), or in the effect details (EFF). MODERATE Details about Rare amino acid effect These are amino acids that occurs very rarely in an organism. For instance, humans are supposed to use 20 amino acids, but there is also one rare AA. Selenocysteine, single letter code 'U', appears roughly 100 times in the whole genome. The amino acid is so rare that usually it does not appear in codon translation tables. It is encoded as UGA, which usually means a STOP codon. Secondary RNA structures are assumed to enable this special translation. A variant in one of these sites is likely to cause a loss of function in the protein. E.g. in case of a Selenocysteine, a loss of a selenium molecule is likely to cause loss of function. Put it simply, the assumption is that there is a great deal of trouble to get that non-standard amino acid there, so it must be important. RARE_AMINO_ACID mark is used to show that special attention should be paid in these cases. Warning When the variant hits a RARE_AMINO_ACID mark, it is likely that the 'old_AA/new_AA' field will be incorrect. This may happen because the amino acid is not predictable using a codon table. Details about Protein interaction effects Protein interactions are calculated from PDB . There are two main types of interactions: protein_protein_contact: These are \"protein-protein\" interaction loci. They are calculated from PDB's co-crystalized structures by inferring pairs of amino acids in different proteins that have atoms closer than 3 Angstrom from each other. structural_interaction_variant: These are \"within protein\" interaction loci, which are likely to be supporting the protein structure. They are calculated from single protein PDB entries, by selecting amino acids that are: a) atom within 3 Angstrom of each other; and b) are far away in the AA sequence (over 20 AA distance). The assumption is that, since they are very close in distance, they must be \"interacting\" and thus important for protein structure. Impact prediction SnpEff reports putative variant impact in order to make it easier quickly to categorize and prioritize variants. Warning Impact categories must be used with care, they were created only to help and simplify the filtering process. Obviously, there is no way to predict whether a HIGH impact or a LOW impact variant is the one producing a phenotype of interest. Impact Meaning Example HIGH The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein, probably causing protein truncation, loss of function or triggering nonsense mediated decay. stop_gained, frameshift_variant MODERATE A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness. missense_variant, inframe_deletion LOW Assumed to be mostly harmless or unlikely to change protein behavior. synonymous_variant MODIFIER Usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no evidence of impact. exon_variant, downstream_gene_variant Loss of function (LOF) and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) predictions Loss of function ('LOF') and nonsense-mediated decay ('NMD') predictions. In older versions, this prediction was activated using command line option -lof , but as of version 4.0, it is activated by default. Some details on how these variants work, can be found in these slides . Info Starting from version 4.0, this option is activated by default. Analyze if a set of effects are can create a \"Loss Of Function\" and \"Nonsense mediated decays\" effects. Needless to say, this is a prediction based on analysis of groups of \"putative effects\". Proper wet-lab validation is required to infer \"real\" LOF. References: I used the LOF definition used in the following paper A Systematic Survey of Loss-of-Function Variants in Human Protein-Coding Genes . From the paper: We adopted a definition for LoF variants expected to correlate with complete loss of function of the affected transcripts: stop codon-introducing (nonsense) or splice site-disrupting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion (indel) variants predicted to disrupt a transcript's reading frame, or larger deletions removing either the first exon or more than 50% of the protein-coding sequence of the affected transcript. Both nonsense SNVs and frameshift indels are enriched toward the 3' end of the affected gene, consistent with a greater tolerance to truncation close to the end of the coding sequence; putative LoF variants identified in the last 5% of the coding region were thus systematically removed from our high-confidence set. Other parameters used for LOF/NMD calculations: Number of bases before last exon-exon junction that nonsense mediated decay is supposed to occur: 50 It is assumed that even with a protein coding change at the last 5% of the protein, the protein could still be functional. It is assumed that even with a protein coding change at the first 5% of the protein: \"..suggesting some disrupted transcripts are rescued by transcriptional reinitiation at an alternative start codon.\" Larger deletions removing either the first exon or more than 50% of the protein-coding sequence of the affected transcript Usage example: # Note: Form version 4.0 onwards, the '-lof' command line option is not required java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -v \\ -lof \\ GRCh37.75 \\ test.chr22.vcf > test.chr22.ann.vcf SnpEff adds 'LOF' and 'NMD' tags to INFO fields (column 8 in VCF format). LOF and NMD tags have the following format: Gene | ID | num_transcripts | percent_affected Where: Field Description Gene Gene name ID Gene ID (usually ENSEMBL) Num_transcripts Number of transcripts in this gene percent_affected Percentage of transcripts affected by this variant. Example: If we have this effect EFF=stop_gained(LOW|NONSENSE|Gga/Tga|p.Gly163*/c.487G>T|574|GAB4|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000400588|3|1),... and the corresponding LOF and NMD tags are LOF=(GAB4|ENSG00000215568|4|0.25);NMD=(GAB4|ENSG00000215568|4|0.25) The meaning of the LOF tag is: Field Description Gene GAB4 ID ENSG00000215568 Num_transcripts There are 4 transcripts in this gene percent_affected 25% of transcripts are affected by this variant. Errors and Warnings As mentioned int the previous section, the last sub-field in EFF field shows errors or warnings (if any). Here is a description of the errors and warnings: Error Meaning and possible solutions ERROR_CHROMOSOME_NOT_FOUND Chromosome does not exits in reference database. See this FAQ for more details. ERROR_OUT_OF_CHROMOSOME_RANGE This means that the position is higher than chromosome's length. Probably an indicator that your data is not from this reference genome. ERROR_OUT_OF_EXON Exonic information not matching the coordinates. Indicates a problem (or even a bug?) in the database ERROR_MISSING_CDS_SEQUENCE Transcript has no CDS info. Indicates a problem (or even a bug?) in the database Warning Meaning and possible solutions WARNING_REF_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GENOME This means that the REF field does not match the reference genome. Warning! This warning probably indicated there is something really wrong with your data! This happens when your data was aligned to a different reference genome than the one used to create SnpEff's database. If there are many of these warnings, it's a strong indicator that the data doesn't match and all the annotations will be garbage (because you are using the wrong database). Solution: Use the right database to annotate! Due to performance and memory optimizations, SnpEff only checks reference sequence on Exons. WARNING_SEQUENCE_NOT_AVAILABLE For some reason the exon sequence is not available, so we cannot calculate effects. WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_INCOMPLETE A protein coding transcript whose length is non-multiple of 3. This means that information is missing for one or more amino acids. This is usually due to errors in the genomic information (e.g. the genomic databases provided by UCSC or ENSEMBL). Genomic information databases are constantly being improved and are getting more accurate, but some errors still remain. WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_MULTIPLE_STOP_CODONS A protein coding transcript has two or more STOP codons in the middle of the coding sequence (CDS). This should not happen and it usually means the genomic information may have an error in this transcript. This is usually due to errors in the genomic information (e.g. the genomic databases provided by UCSC or ENSEMBL). Genomic information databases are constantly being improved and are getting more accurate, but some errors still remain. WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_NO_START_CODON A protein coding transcript does not have a proper START codon. It is rare that a real transcript does not have a START codon, so this probably indicates errors in genomic information for this transcript (e.g. the genomic databases provided by UCSC or ENSEMBL). Genomic information databases are constantly being improved and are getting more accurate, but some errors still remain. BED files In an enrichment experiment, such as ChIP-Seq, the results are enrichment regions, usually called \"peaks\". It is common for \"peak callers\" (algorithms that detect enrichment), write the results in a BED file. SnpEff can annotate BED files in order to facilitate interpretation of enrichment experiments. Warning Column fifth onwards are ignored when using BED file format and they will be lost in the output file. SnpEff can annotate BED files in order to facilitate interpretation of enrichment experiments. Annotations are added to the fourth column of the BED file.

Exon naming convention The format for the exon identifier is exon_Rank_Total_Type , where: rank is the exon rank in the transcript (position in the transcript) total is the total number of exons in that transcript type is the exon splice type. For instance exon_5_10_RETAINED would be the fifth exon in a 10 exon transcript. This exon is type \"RETAINED\", which means it is not spliced out. Exons are categorized by splicing as follows: NONE : Not spliced RETAINED : All transcripts have this exon SKIPPED : Some transcripts skip it ALTTENATIVE_3SS : Some transcripts have and alternative 3' exon start ALTTENATIVE_5SS : Some transcripts have and alternative 5' exon end MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE : Mutually exclusive (respect to other exon) ALTTENATIVE_PROMOMOTER : The first exon is different in some transcripts. ALTTENATIVE_POLY_A : The last exon. See this Wikipedia entry for more information on exon splice types. Intron naming convention Similarly to exons, introns are named as intron_Rank_ExonTypeBefore-ExonTypeAfter , where: Rank : the rank number for this intron in the transcript ExonTypeBefore : the splicing type of the exon preceding this intron (see exon naming convention for details). ExonTypeAfter : the splicing type of the after this intron (see exon naming convention for details). For instance intron_9_SKIPPED-RETAINED would be the ninth intron of the transcript. The intron is preceded by a SKIPPED exon and followed by a RETAINED exon.","title":"Input &amp; output files"},{"location":"se_inputoutput/#input-output-files","text":"Files used as input to SnpEff must comply with standard formats. Here we describe supported input data formats.","title":"Input &amp; output files"},{"location":"se_inputoutput/#vcf-files","text":"As we mentioned before, Variant Call Format (VCF) is the recommended format for input files. This is the format used by the \"1000 Genomes Project\", and is currently considered the de facto standard for genomic variants. It is also the default format used in SnpEff. In a nutshell, VCF format is tab-separated text file having the following columns: Chromosome name Position Variant's ID Reference genome Alternative (i.e. variant) Quality score Filter (whether or not the variant passed quality filters) INFO : Generic information about this variant.

Compound variants: two or more variants affecting the annotations (e.g. two consecutive SNPs conforming a MNP, two consecutive frame_shift variants that \"recover\" the frame).

Tissue specific features may include cell type / tissue information separated by semicolon e.g.: ANN=A|histone_binding_site|LOW|||H3K4me3:HeLa-S3| Feature ID: Depending on the annotation, this may be: Transcript ID (preferably using version number), Motif ID, miRNA, ChipSeq peak, Histone mark, etc. Note: Some features may not have ID (e.g. histone marks from custom Chip-Seq experiments may not have a unique ID). Transcript biotype: The bare minimum is at least a description on whether the transcript is {\"Coding\", \"Noncoding\"}. Whenever possible, use ENSEMBL biotypes.

All these errors, warnings or information messages messages are optional. Code Message type Description / Notes E1 ERROR_CHROMOSOME_NOT_FOUND Chromosome does not exists in reference genome database. Typically indicates a mismatch between the chromosome names in the input file and the chromosome names used in the reference genome. E2 ERROR_OUT_OF_CHROMOSOME_RANGE The variant's genomic coordinate is greater than chromosome's length. W1 WARNING_REF_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GENOME This means that the 'REF' field in the input VCF file does not match the reference genome. This warning may indicate a conflict between input data and data from reference genome (for instance is the input VCF was aligned to a different reference genome). W2 WARNING_SEQUENCE_NOT_AVAILABLE Reference sequence is not available, thus no inference could be performed. W3 WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_INCOMPLETE A protein coding transcript having a non-multiple of 3 length. It indicates that the reference genome has missing information about this particular transcript. W4 WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_MULTIPLE_STOP_CODONS A protein coding transcript has two or more STOP codons in the middle of the coding sequence (CDS). This should not happen and it usually means the reference genome may have an error in this transcript. W5 WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_NO_START_CODON A protein coding transcript does not have a proper START codon. It is rare that a real transcript does not have a START codon, so this probably indicates an error or missing information in the reference genome. I1 INFO_REALIGN_3_PRIME Variant has been realigned to the most 3-prime position within the transcript. This is usually done to to comply with HGVS specification to always report the most 3-prime annotation. I2 INFO_COMPOUND_ANNOTATION This effect is a result of combining more than one variants (e.g. two consecutive SNPs that conform an MNP, or two consecutive frame_shift variants that compensate frame). I3 INFO_NON_REFERENCE_ANNOTATION An alternative reference sequence was used to calculate this annotation (e.g. cancer sample comparing somatic vs. germline). Consistency between HGVS and functional annotations: In some cases there might be inconsistent reporting between 'annotation' and HGVS. This is due to the fact that VCF recommends aligning to the leftmost coordinate, whereas HGSV recommends aligning to the \"most 3-prime coordinate\". For instance, an InDel on the edge of an exon, which has an 'intronic' annotation according to VCF alignment recommendation, can lead to a 'stop_gained' when aligned using HGVS's recommendation (using the most 3-prime possible alignment). So the 'annotation' sub-field will report 'intron' whereas HGVS sub-field will report a 'stop_gained'. This is obviously inconsistent and must be avoided. In order to report annotations that are consistent with HGVS notation, variants must be re-aligned according to each transcript's strand (i.e. align the variant according to the transcript's most 3-prime coordinate). Then annotations are calculated, thus the reported annotations will be consistent with HGVS notation. Annotation software should have a command line option to override this behaviour (e.g. -no_shift_hgvs )","title":"ANN field (VCF output files)"},{"location":"se_inputoutput/#eff-field-vcf-output-files","text":"Effects information is added to the INFO field using an 'EFF' tag.

For instance, humans are supposed to use 20 amino acids, but there is also one rare AA. Selenocysteine, single letter code 'U', appears roughly 100 times in the whole genome. The amino acid is so rare that usually it does not appear in codon translation tables. It is encoded as UGA, which usually means a STOP codon. Secondary RNA structures are assumed to enable this special translation. A variant in one of these sites is likely to cause a loss of function in the protein. E.g. in case of a Selenocysteine, a loss of a selenium molecule is likely to cause loss of function. Put it simply, the assumption is that there is a great deal of trouble to get that non-standard amino acid there, so it must be important.

Both nonsense SNVs and frameshift indels are enriched toward the 3' end of the affected gene, consistent with a greater tolerance to truncation close to the end of the coding sequence; putative LoF variants identified in the last 5% of the coding region were thus systematically removed from our high-confidence set. Other parameters used for LOF/NMD calculations: Number of bases before last exon-exon junction that nonsense mediated decay is supposed to occur: 50 It is assumed that even with a protein coding change at the last 5% of the protein, the protein could still be functional.

Here is a description of the errors and warnings: Error Meaning and possible solutions ERROR_CHROMOSOME_NOT_FOUND Chromosome does not exits in reference database. See this FAQ for more details. ERROR_OUT_OF_CHROMOSOME_RANGE This means that the position is higher than chromosome's length. Probably an indicator that your data is not from this reference genome. ERROR_OUT_OF_EXON Exonic information not matching the coordinates. Indicates a problem (or even a bug?) in the database ERROR_MISSING_CDS_SEQUENCE Transcript has no CDS info. Indicates a problem (or even a bug?) in the database Warning Meaning and possible solutions WARNING_REF_DOES_NOT_MATCH_GENOME This means that the REF field does not match the reference genome. Warning! This warning probably indicated there is something really wrong with your data! This happens when your data was aligned to a different reference genome than the one used to create SnpEff's database. If there are many of these warnings, it's a strong indicator that the data doesn't match and all the annotations will be garbage (because you are using the wrong database). Solution: Use the right database to annotate! Due to performance and memory optimizations, SnpEff only checks reference sequence on Exons. WARNING_SEQUENCE_NOT_AVAILABLE For some reason the exon sequence is not available, so we cannot calculate effects. WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_INCOMPLETE A protein coding transcript whose length is non-multiple of 3. This means that information is missing for one or more amino acids. This is usually due to errors in the genomic information (e.g. the genomic databases provided by UCSC or ENSEMBL). Genomic information databases are constantly being improved and are getting more accurate, but some errors still remain. WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_MULTIPLE_STOP_CODONS A protein coding transcript has two or more STOP codons in the middle of the coding sequence (CDS). This should not happen and it usually means the genomic information may have an error in this transcript. This is usually due to errors in the genomic information (e.g. the genomic databases provided by UCSC or ENSEMBL). Genomic information databases are constantly being improved and are getting more accurate, but some errors still remain. WARNING_TRANSCRIPT_NO_START_CODON A protein coding transcript does not have a proper START codon. It is rare that a real transcript does not have a START codon, so this probably indicates errors in genomic information for this transcript (e.g. the genomic databases provided by UCSC or ENSEMBL). Genomic information databases are constantly being improved and are getting more accurate, but some errors still remain.","title":"Errors and Warnings"},{"location":"se_inputoutput/#bed-files","text":"In an enrichment experiment, such as ChIP-Seq, the results are enrichment regions, usually called \"peaks\".

It annotates and predicts the effects of genetic variants (such as amino acid changes). For older version of this page, see: Manual page for SnpEff version 4.1 Download & Install Download and installing SnpEff it pretty easy, take a look at the download page . Building from source Take a look at the \"Source code\" section. SnpEff Summary A typical SnpEff use case would be: Input: The inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions and MNPs). The input file is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing experiment, and it is usually in variant call format (VCF). Output: SnpEff analyzes the input variants. It annotates the variants and calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g. amino acid changes). A list of effects and annotations that SnpEff can calculate can be found here . Variants By genetic variant we mean difference between a genome and a \"reference\" genome. As an example, imagine we are sequencing a \"sample\". Here \"sample\" can mean anything that you are interested in studying, from a cell culture, to a mouse or a cancer patient. It is a standard procedure to compare your sample sequences against the corresponding \"reference genome\". For instance you may compare the cancer patient genome against the \"reference genome\". In a typical sequencing experiment, you will find many places in the genome where your sample differs from the reference genome. These are called \"genomic variants\" or just \"variants\". Typically, variants are categorized as follows: Type What is means Example SNP Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Reference = 'A', Sample = 'C' Ins Insertion Reference = 'A', Sample = 'AGT' Del Deletion Reference = 'AC', Sample = 'C' MNP Multiple-nucleotide polymorphism Reference = 'ATA', Sample = 'GTC' MIXED Multiple-nucleotide and an InDel Reference = 'ATA', Sample = 'GTCAGT' This is not a comprehensive list, it is just to give you an idea. Annotations So, you have a huge file describing all the differences between your sample and the reference genome. But you want to know more about these variants than just their genetic coordinates. E.g.: Are they in a gene? In an exon? Do they change protein coding? Do they cause premature stop codons? SnpEff can help you answer all these questions. The process of adding this information about the variants is called \"Annotation\". SnpEff provides several degrees of annotations, from simple (e.g. which gene is each variant affecting) to extremely complex annotations (e.g. will this non-coding variant affect the expression of a gene?). It should be noted that the more complex the annotations, the more it relies in computational predictions. Such computational predictions can be incorrect, so results from SnpEff (or any prediction algorithm) cannot be trusted blindly, they must be analyzed and independently validated by corresponding wet-lab experiments. Citing If you are using SnpEff or SnpSift, please cite our work as shown here . Thank you! SnpEff Features The following table shows the main SnpEff features: Feature Comment Local install SnpEff can be installed in your local computer or servers. Local installations are preferred for processing genomic data. As opposed to remote web-based services, running a program locally has many advantages: There no need to upload huge genomic dataset. Processing doesn't depend on availability or processing capacity of remote servers. Service continuity: no need to worry if a remote service will be maintained in the future. Security and confidentiality issues of uploading data to third party servers are not a problem. Avoid legal problems of processing clinical data on \"outside\" servers. Multi platform SnpEff is written in Java. It runs on Unix / Linux, OS.X and Windows. Simple installation Installation is as simple as downloading a ZIP file and double clicking on it. Genomes Human genome, as well as all model organisms are supported. Over 2,500 genomes are supported, which includes most mammalian, plant, bacterial and fungal genomes with published genomic data. Speed SnpEff is really fast. It can annotate up to 1,000,000 variants per minute. GATK&Galaxy integration SnpEff can be easily integrated with GATK and Galaxy pipelines. GUI Web based user interface via Galaxy project Input and Output formats SnpEff accepts input files in the following format: VCF format, which is the de-facto standard for sequencing variants. BED format: To annotate enrichment experiments (e.g. ChIP-Seq peaks) or other genomic data. Variants supported SnpEff can annotate SNPs, MNPs, insertions and deletions. Support for mixed variants and structural variants is available (although sometimes limited). Effect supported Many effects are calculated: such as SYNONYMOUS_CODING, NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, FRAME_SHIFT, STOP_GAINED just to name a few. Variant impact SnpEff provides a simple assessment of the putative impact of the variant (e.g. HIGH, MODERATE or LOW impact). Cancer tissue analysis Somatic vs Germline mutations can be calculated on the fly. This is very useful for the cancer researcher community. Loss of Function (LOF) assessment SnpEff can estimate if a variant is deemed to have a loss of function on the protein. Nonsense mediate decay (NMD) assessment Some mutations may cause mRNA to be degraded thus not translated into a protein. NMD analysis marks mutations that are estimated to trigger nonsense mediated decay. HGVS notation SnpEff can provide output in HGVS notation, which is quite popular in clinical and translation research environments. User annotations A user can provide custom annotations (by means of BED files). Public databases SnpEff can annotate using publicly available data from well known databases, for instance: ENCODE datasets are supported by SnpEff (by means of BigWig files provided by ENCODE project). Epigenome Roadmap provides data-sets that can be used with SnpEff. TFBS Transcription factor binding site predictions can be annotated. Motif data used in this annotations is generates by Jaspar and ENSEBML projects NextProt database can be used to annotate protein domains as well as important functional sites in a protein (e.g. phosphorilation site) Common variants (dbSnp) Annotating \"common\" variants from dbSnp and 1,000 Genomes can be easily done (see SnpSift annotate ). Gwas catalog Support for GWAS catalog annotations (see SnpSift gwasCat ) Conservation scores PhastCons conservation score annotations support (see SnpSift phastCons ) DbNsfp A comprehensive database providing many annotations and scores, such as: SIFT , Polyphen2 , GERP++ , PhyloP , MutationTaster , SiPhy , Interpro , Haploinsufficiency , etc. (via SnpSift). See SnpSift dbnsfp for details. Non-coding annotations Regulatory and non-coding annotations are supported for different tissues and cell lines. Annotations supported include PolII,H3K27ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, CTCF, H3K36me3, just to name a few. Gene Sets annotations Gene sets (MSigDb, GO, BioCarta, KEGG, Reactome, etc.) can be used to annotate via SnpSift geneSets command. Databases In order to produce the annotations, SnpEff requires a database. We build these databases using information from trusted resources. Info By default SnpEff downloads and installs databases automatically (since version 4.0) Currently, there are pre-built database for over 20,000 reference genomes. This means that most cases are covered. In some very rare occasions, people need to build a database for an organism not currently supported (e.g. the genome is not publicly available). In most cases, this can be done and there is a section of this manual teaching how to build your own SnpEff database. Which databases are supported? You can find out all the supported databases by running the databases command: $ java -jar snpEff.jar databases | less This command shows the database name, genome name and source data (where was the genome reference data obtained from). Keep in mind that many times I use ENSEMBL reference genomes, so the name would be GRCh37 instead of hg19 , or GRCm38 instead of mm10 , and so on. Example: Finding a database: So, let's say you want to find out the name of the latest mouse (Mus.Musculus) database. You can runs something like this: $ java -jar snpEff.jar databases | grep -i musculus GRCm38.68 Mus_musculus OK http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.69 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.70 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.71 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.72 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.73 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.74 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip NCBIM37.64 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip NCBIM37.65 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip NCBIM37.66 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip At the time of writing this, you have 10 options (obviously this will change in the future). Some are databases are GRCm version 37 (i.e. mm9) and some are version 38 (i.e. mm10). Since it is generally better to use the latest release, you should probably pick GRCm38.74 . Again, this is an example of the version numbers at the time of writing this paragraph, in the future there will be other releases and you should update to the corresponding version. Unsupported reference genomes: If your reference genome of interest is not supported yet (i.e. there is no database available), you can build a database yourself (see Building databases ). If you have problems adding you own organism, send the issue to SnpEff repository and I'll do my best to help you out.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"se_introduction/#introduction","text":"SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool.

Info By default SnpEff downloads and installs databases automatically (since version 4.0) Currently, there are pre-built database for over 20,000 reference genomes. This means that most cases are covered. In some very rare occasions, people need to build a database for an organism not currently supported (e.g. the genome is not publicly available). In most cases, this can be done and there is a section of this manual teaching how to build your own SnpEff database. Which databases are supported? You can find out all the supported databases by running the databases command: $ java -jar snpEff.jar databases | less This command shows the database name, genome name and source data (where was the genome reference data obtained from). Keep in mind that many times I use ENSEMBL reference genomes, so the name would be GRCh37 instead of hg19 , or GRCm38 instead of mm10 , and so on. Example: Finding a database: So, let's say you want to find out the name of the latest mouse (Mus.Musculus) database. You can runs something like this: $ java -jar snpEff.jar databases | grep -i musculus GRCm38.68 Mus_musculus OK http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.69 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.70 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.71 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.72 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.73 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip GRCm38.74 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip NCBIM37.64 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip NCBIM37.65 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip NCBIM37.66 Mus_musculus http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/databases/v3.4/snpEff_v3.4_Mus_musculus.zip At the time of writing this, you have 10 options (obviously this will change in the future). Some are databases are GRCm version 37 (i.e. mm9) and some are version 38 (i.e. mm10). Since it is generally better to use the latest release, you should probably pick GRCm38.74 . Again, this is an example of the version numbers at the time of writing this paragraph, in the future there will be other releases and you should update to the corresponding version. Unsupported reference genomes: If your reference genome of interest is not supported yet (i.e. there is no database available), you can build a database yourself (see Building databases ). If you have problems adding you own organism, send the issue to SnpEff repository and I'll do my best to help you out.","title":"Databases"},{"location":"se_outputsummary/","text":"Output summary Files SnpEff creates an additional output file showing overall statistics. This \"stats\" file is an HTML file which can be opened using a web browser. You can find an example of a 'stats' file here . HTML summary (snpEff_summary.html) The program performs some statistics and saves them to the file 'snpEff_summary.html' on the directory where snpEff is being executed. You can see the file, by opening it in your browser. Info You can change the default location by using the -stats command line option. This also changes the location of the TXT summary file. Info Summary can be create in CSV format using command line option -csvStats . This allows easy downstream processing. E.g.: In the stats file, you can see coverage histogram plots like this one: \"Effects by type\" vs \"Effects by region\" SnpEff annotates variants. Variants produce effect of difference \"types\" (e.g. NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, STOP_GAINED). These variants affect regions of the genome (e.g. EXON, INTRON). The two tables count how many effects for each type and for each region exists. E.g.: In an EXON region, you can have all the following effect types: NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, SYNONYMOUS_CODING, FRAME_SHIFT, STOP_GAINED, etc. The complicated part is that some effect types affect a region that has the same name (yes, I know, this is confusing). E.g.: In a UTR_5_PRIME region you can have UTR_5_PRIME and START_GAINED effect type. This means that the number of both tables are not exactly the same, because the labels don't mean the same. See the next figure as an example: So the number of effects that affect a UTR_5_PRIME region is 206. Of those, 57 are effects type START_GAINED and 149 are effects type UTR_5_PRIME. How exactly are effect type and effect region related?

Basic example: Installing SnpEff Obviously the first step to use the program is to install it (for details, take a look at the download page . You have to download the core program and then uncompress the ZIP file. In Windows systems, you can just double click and copy the contents of the ZIP file to wherever you want the program installed. If you have a Unix or a Mac system, the command line would be: # Download using wget $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip # If you prefer to use 'curl' instead of 'wget', you can type: # curl -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip > snpEff_latest_core.zip # Install $ unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip Basic example: Annotate using SnpEff Let's assume you have a VCF file and you want to annotate the variants in that file. An example file is provided in examples/test.chr22.vcf (this data is from the 1000 Genomes project, so the reference genome is the human genome GRCh37).

Notice how SnpEff automatically downloads and installs the database. Next time SnpEff will use the local version, so the installation step is only done once. The annotated variants will be in the new file \"test.chr22.ann.vcf\". Warning SnpEff creates a file called \"snpEff_summary.html\" showing basic statistics about the analyzed variants. Take a quick look at it. Info We used the java parameter -Xmx4g to increase the memory available to the Java Virtual Machine to 4G. SnpEff's human genome database is large and it has to be loaded into memory. If your computer doesn't have at least 4G of memory, you probably won't be able to run this example. Info If you are running SnpEff from a directory different than the one it was installed, you will have to specify where the config file is. This is done using the '-c' command line option: java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -c path/to/snpEff/snpEff.config -v GRCh37.75 test.chr22.vcf > test.chr22.ann.vcf Detailed examples Take a look at several detailed examples in our examples page . Specify a configuration file Sometimes you need to specify the path to the config file. For instance, when you run SnpEff from a different directory than your install directory, you have to specify where the config file is located using the '-c' command line option. java -Xmx4g path/to/snpEff/snpEff.jar -c path/to/snpEff/snpEff.config GRCh37.75 path/to/snps.vcf Info Since version 4.1B, you can use the -configOption command line option to override any value in the config file Java memory options By default the amount of memory set by a java process is set too low. If you don't assign more memory to the process, you will most likely have an \"OutOfMemory\" error. You should set the amount of memory in your java virtual machine to, at least, 2 Gb. This can be easily done using the Java command line option -Xmx . E.g. In this example I use 4Gb: # Run using 4 Gb of memory java -Xmx4G snpEff.jar hg19 path/to/your/files/snps.vcf Note: There is no space between -Xmx and 4G . Running SnpEff in the Cloud You can run SnpEff in a \"the Cloud\" exactly the same way as running it on your local computer. You should not have any problems at all. Here is an example of installing it and running it on an Amazon EC2 instance (virtual machine): $ ssh -i ./aws_amazon/pcingola_aws.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-234-14-244.compute-1.amazonaws.com __| __|_ ) _| ( / Amazon Linux AMI ___|\\___|___| [ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 ~]$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip [ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 ~]$ unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip [ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 ~]$ cd snpEff/ [ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 snpEff]$ java -jar snpEff.jar download -v hg19 00:00:00.000 Downloading database for 'hg19' ... 00:00:36.340 Done [ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 snpEff]$ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar dump -v hg19 > /dev/null 00:00:00.000 Reading database for genome 'hg19' (this might take a while) 00:00:20.688 done 00:00:20.688 Building interval forest 00:00:33.110 Done. As you can see, it's very simple. Loading the database One of the first thins SnpEff has to do is to load the database. Usually it takes from a few seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on database size. Complex databases, like human, require more time to load. After the database is loaded, SnpEff can analyze thousands of variants per second. Command line vs Web interface In order to run SnpEff you need to be comfortable running command from a command line terminal. If you are not, then it is probably a good idea to ask you systems administrator to install a Galaxy server and use the web interface. You can also use the open Galaxy server, but functionality may be limited and SnpEff versions may not be updated frequently.","title":"Running SnpEff"},{"location":"se_running/#running-snpeff","text":"We show some basic examples how to use SnpEff.","title":"Running SnpEff"},{"location":"se_running/#basic-example-installing-snpeff","text":"Obviously the first step to use the program is to install it (for details, take a look at the download page .

Apparent inconsistencies when using UCSC genome browser Warning Usage of hg19 genome is deprecated and discouraged, you should use GRChXX.YY instead (e.g. the latest version at the time of writing is GRCh37.70) Reference sequence and annotations are made for an organism version and sub-version. For examples human genome, version 37, sub-version 70 would be called (GRCh37.70). UCSC doesn't specify sub-version. They just say hg19. This annoying sub-version problem appeared often and, having reproducibility of results in mind, I dropped UCSC annotations in favor of ENSEMBL ones (they have clear versioning). SnpEff reporting an effect that doesn't match ENSEMBL's web page Please remember that databases are updated often (e.g. by ENSEMBL), so if you are using an old database, you might get different effects. For example, this transcript ENST00000487462 changed from protein_coding in GRCh37.63 1 protein_coding exon 1655388 1655458 . - . gene_id \"ENSG00000008128\"; transcript_id \"ENST00000487462\"; exon_number \"1\"; gene_name \"CDK11A\"; transcript_name \"CDK11A-013\"; 1 protein_coding exon 1653905 1654270 . - . gene_id \"ENSG00000008128\"; transcript_id \"ENST00000487462\"; exon_number \"2\"; gene_name \"CDK11A\"; transcript_name \"CDK11A-013\"; ...to processed_transcript in GRCh37.64: 1 processed_transcript exon 1655388 1655458 . - . gene_id \"ENSG00000008128\"; transcript_id \"ENST00000487462\"; exon_number \"1\"; gene_name \"CDK11A\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\"; transcript_name \"CDK11A-013\"; 1 processed_transcript exon 1653905 1654270 . - . gene_id \"ENSG00000008128\"; transcript_id \"ENST00000487462\"; exon_number \"2\"; gene_name \"CDK11A\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\"; transcript_name \"CDK11A-013\"; This means that you'll get different results for this transcript using sub-version 63 or 64. I assume that latest versions are improved, so I always encourage to upgrade. Sometimes it might even be the case that latest released database and the one shown on the web interface may be out of sync. SnpEff reports a SYNONYMOUS and a NON_SYNONYMOUS effect on the same gene This is not a bug. It is not uncommon for a gene to have more than one transcript (e.g. in human most genes have multiple transcripts). A variant (e.g. a SNP) might affect different transcripts in different ways, as a result of different reading frames. For instance: chr5 137622242 . C T . .

Counting total number of effects of a given type Some people try to count the number of effects in a file by doing (assuming we want to count how many MODIFIER effects we have): grep -o MODIFIER output.ann.vcf | wc -l This is incorrect because a VCF line can have multiple effects (e.g. when there are multiple transcripts in a gene).

SnpSift Concordance Calculate concordance between two VCF files. Typical usage This is typically used when you want to calculate concordance between a genotyping experiment and a sequencing experiment. For instance, you sequenced several samples and, as part of a related experiment or just as quality control, you also genotype the same samples using a genotyping array. Now you want to compare the two experiments. Ideally there would be no difference between the variants from genotyping and sequencing, but this is hardly the case in real world. You can use SnpSift concordance to measure the differences between the two experiments. Warning It is assumed that both VCF files are sorted by chromosome and position. Warning Sample names are defined in '#CHROM' line of the header section. Concordance is calculated only if sample label matches in both files.

For example, 'change_0_1' counts the number of \"homozygous reference in genotype.vcf\" that changed to \"heterozygous ALT in sequencing.vcf\". Or 'change_2_2' counts the number of \"homozygous ALT\" that did not change (in both files they are '2'). A few rules apply: If a VCF entry (chr:pos) is present in only one of the files, obviously we cannot calculate concordance, so it is ignored. If a VCF entry (chr:pos) has more than one ALT it is ignored. This means that non-biallelic variants are ignored. If, for the same chr:pos, REF field is different between the two files, then the entry is ignored. If, for the same chr:pos, ALT field is different between the two files, then the entry is ignored.

SnpSift dbNSFP The dbNSFP is an integrated database of functional predictions from multiple algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT and MutationTaster, PhyloP and GERP++, etc.). Typical usage One of the main advantages is that you can annotate using multiple prediction tools with just one command. This allows for faster annotations. Here is the link to dbNSFP database website for more details. Database: In order to annotate using dbNSFP, you need to download the dbNSFP database and the index file. dbNSFP is large (several GB) so it might take a while to download it. The database is compressed (block-gzip) and tabix indexed, so two files are required (the data .gz file and the .gz.tbi index file). You can download the files from SnpEff's site (remember that you need both the database and the index file): GRCh37 / hg19 (dbNSFP version 2.9, Academic): Database . Save file as dbNSFP.txt.gz Index . Save file as dbNSFP.txt.gz.tbi GRCh38 / hg38 (dbNSFP version 3.2 Academic): Database . Save file as dbNSFP.txt.gz Index .

SnpSift filter SnpSift filter is one of the most useful SnpSift commands. Using SnpSift filter you can filter VCF files using arbitrary expressions, for instance \"(QUAL > 30) | (exists INDEL) | ( countHet() > 2 )\" . The actual expressions can be quite complex, so it allows for a lot of flexibility. Typical usage Some examples for the impatient: I want to filter out samples with quality less than 30: cat variants.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \" ( QUAL >= 30 )\" > filtered.vcf ...but we also want InDels that have quality 20 or more: cat variants.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"(( exists INDEL ) & (QUAL >= 20)) | (QUAL >= 30 )\" > filtered.vcf ...or any homozygous variant present in more than 3 samples: cat variants.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"(countHom() > 3) | (( exists INDEL ) & (QUAL >= 20)) | (QUAL >= 30 )\" > filtered.vcf ...or any heterozygous sample with coverage 25 or more: cat variants.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"((countHet() > 0) && (DP >= 25)) | (countHom() > 3) | (( exists INDEL ) & (QUAL >= 20)) | (QUAL >= 30 )\" > filtered.vcf I want to keep samples where the genotype for the first sample is homozygous variant and the genotype for the second sample is reference: cat variants.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"isHom( GEN[0] ) & isVariant( GEN[0] ) & isRef( GEN[1] )\" > filtered.vcf I want to keep samples where the ID matches a set defined in a file: cat variants.vcf | java -jar SnpSift.jar filter --set my_rs.txt \"ID in SET[0]\" > filtered.vcf and the file my_rs.txt has one string per line, e.g.: rs58108140 rs71262674 rs71262673 You can combine any conditions you want using boolean operators. Command line options Usage: java -jar SnpSift.jar filter [options] 'expression' [input.vcf] Options: -a|--addFilter : Add a string to FILTER VCF field if 'expression' is true. Default: '' (none) -e|--exprFile : Read expression from a file -f|--file : VCF input file. Default: STDIN -i|--filterId : ID for this filter (##FILTER tag in header and FILTER VCF field). Default: 'SnpSift' -n|--inverse : Inverse. Show lines that do not match filter expression -p|--pass : Use 'PASS' field instead of filtering out VCF entries -r|--rmFilter : Remove a string from FILTER VCF field if 'expression' is true (and 'str' is in the field). Default: '' (none) -s|--set : Create a SET using 'file' --errMissing : Error is a field is missing. Default: false --format : SnpEff format version: {2, 3}. Default: Auto --galaxy : Used from Galaxy (expressions have been sanitized). Variables All VCF fields can be used as variables names, as long as they are declared in the VCF header OR they are \"standard\" VCF fields (as defined by the VCF 4.1 specification). Fields names: \"CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL or FILTER\". Examples: Any variant in chromosome 1: \"( CHROM = 'chr1' )\" Variants between two positions: \"( POS > 123456 ) & ( POS < 654321 )\" Has an ID and it matches the regulat expression 'rs': \"(exists ID) & ( ID =~ 'rs' )\" The reference is 'A': \"( REF = 'A' )\" The alternative is 'T': \"( ALT = 'T' )\" Quality over 30: \"( QUAL > 30 )\" Filter value is either 'PASS' or it is missing: \"( na FILTER ) | (FILTER = 'PASS')\" INFO field names in the INFO field. E.g. if the info field has \"DP=48;AF1=0;...\" you can use something like: \"( DP > 10 ) & ( AF1 = 0 )\" Multiple valued fields and variables When variables have multiple values, you can access individual values as if it was an array. Multiple value info fields (comma separated) can be accessed using an index. E.g. If the INFO field has \"CI95=0.04167,0.5417\" you can use an expression such as: \"( CI95[0] > 0.1 ) & (CI95[1] <= 0.3)\" Multiple indexes You may test multiple indexed fields using 'ANY' or 'ALL' as index. In the examples we assume the INFO field has \"CI95=0.04167,0.5417\" ANY or * : If you use 'ANY' as index, the expression will be true if any field satisfies the expression. So, for instance, the following expressions: \"( CI95[ANY] > 0.1 )\" or: \"( CI95[*] > 0.1 )\" are equivalent to (in this case, there are only two values in the array): \"( CI95[0] > 0.1 ) | ( CI95[1] > 0.1 )\" ALL or ? : If you use 'ALL' as index, the expression will be true if all field satisfy the expression. So, for instance, the following expressions: \"( CI95[ALL] > 0.1 )\" \"( CI95[?] > 0.1 )\" are equivalent to (in this case, there are only two values in the array): \"( CI95[0] > 0.1 ) & ( CI95[1] > 0.1 )\" Genotype fields Vcf genotype fields can be accessed individually using array notation. Genotype fields are accessed using an index (sample number) followed by a variable name. E.g. If the genotypes are GT:PL:GQ 1/1:255,66,0:63 0/1:245,0,255:99 You can write something like: \"( GEN[0].GQ > 60 ) & ( GEN[1].GQ > 90 )\" You may use an asterisk to represent 'ANY' field: \"( GEN[*].GQ > 60 )\" Genotype multiple fields are accessed using an index (sample number) followed by a variable name and then another index. E.g. If the genotypes are GT:PL:GQ 1/1:255,66,0:63 0/1:245,0,255:99 You can write something like: \"( GEN[0].PL[2] = 0 )\" You may use an asterisk to represent 'ANY' field: \"( GEN[0].PL[*] = 0 )\" ...or even: \"( GEN[*].PL[*] = 0 )\" Info You can create an expression using sample names instead of genotype numbers. E.g. $ java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"( GEN[HG00096].DS > 0.2 ) & ( GEN[HG00097].DS > 0.5 )\" examples/1kg.head_chr1.vcf.gz Sets Sets are defined by the '-s' (or '--set') command line option. Each file must have one string per line. They are named based on the order used in the command line (e.g. the first one is SET[0] , the second one is SET[1] , etc.) Example: You can write something like (assuming your command line was \"-s set1.txt -s set2.txt -s set3.txt\"): \"( ID in SET[2] )\" SnpEff 'ANN' fields SnpEff annotations are parsed, so you can access individual sub-fields: Effect fields (from SnpEff) are accessed using an index (effect number) followed by a sub-field name. Available ANN sub-fields are (for details, take a look at the specification ): ALLELE (alias GENOTYPE) EFFECT (alias ANNOTATION): Effect in Sequence ontology terms (e.g. 'missense_variant', 'synonymous_variant', 'stop_gained', etc.) IMPACT: { HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, MODIFIER } GENE: Gene name (e.g. 'PSD3') GENEID: Gene ID FEATURE FEATUREID (alias TRID: Transcript ID) BIOTYPE: Biotype, as described by the annotations (e.g. 'protein_coding') RANK: Exon or Intron rank (i.e. exon number in a transcript) HGVS_C (alias HGVS_DNA, CODON): Variant in HGVS (DNA) notation HGVS_P (alias HGVS, HGVS_PROT, AA): Variant in HGVS (protein) notation CDNA_POS (alias POS_CDNA) CDNA_LEN (alias LEN_CDNA) CDS_POS (alias POS_CDS) CDS_LEN (alias LEN_CDS) AA_POS (alias POS_AA) AA_LEN (alias LEN_AA) DISTANCE ERRORS (alias WARNING, INFOS) For example, you may want only the lines where the first annotation has missense_variant variant: Important According to the specification, there can be more than one EFFECT separated by & (e.g. 'missense_variant&splice_region_variant', thus using has operator is better than using equality operator ( = ). For instance 'missense_variant&splice_region_variant' = 'missense_variant' is false, whereas 'missense_variant&splice_region_variant' has 'missense_variant' is true. $ java -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"ANN[0].EFFECT has 'missense_variant'\" examples/test.chr22.ann.vcf > test.chr22.ann.filter_missense_first.vcf # Output example (edited for readability) $ cat test.chr22.ann.filter_missense_first.vcf 22 17072035 .

SnpEff 'EFF' fields Warning This section documents older SnpEff/SnpSift which used 'EFF' INFO field (as opposed to 'ANN' field) or files annotated using SnpEff's -classic or -formatEff command line options. SnpEff annotations are parsed, so you can access individual sub-fields: Effect fields (from SnpEff) are accessed using an index (effect number) followed by a sub-field name. Available EFF sub-fields are: EFFECT: Effect (e.g. SYNONYMOUS_CODING, NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, FRAME_SHIFT, etc.) IMPACT: { HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, MODIFIER } FUNCLASS: { NONE, SILENT, MISSENSE, NONSENSE } CODON: Codon change (e.g. 'ggT/ggG') AA: Amino acid change (e.g. 'G156') GENE: Gene name (e.g. 'PSD3') BIOTYPE: Gene biotype, as described by the annotations (e.g. 'protein_coding') CODING: Gene is { CODING, NON_CODING } TRID: Transcript ID RANK: Exon or Intron rank (i.e. exon number in a transcript) For example, you may want only the lines where the first effect is a NON_SYNONYMOUS variants: \"( EFF[0].EFFECT = 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING' )\" ...but this probably doesn't make much sense. What you may really want are lines where ANY effect is NON_SYNONYMOUS: \"( EFF[*].EFFECT = 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING' )\" May be you want only the ones that affect gene 'TCF7L2': \"( EFF[*].EFFECT = 'NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING' ) & ( EFF[*].GENE = 'TCF7L2' )\" SnpEff 'LOF' and 'NMD' fields Similarly LOF and NMD sub-fields are available: LOF.GENE and NMD.GENE LOF.GENEID and NMD.GENEID LOF.NUMTR and NMD.NUMTR LOF.PERC and NMD.PERC For instance, if we want to obtain genes having a Loss of Function effect in more than 90% of the transcripts, you can do this: $cat test.snpeff.vcf | java -Xmx1G -jar SnpSift.jar filter \"(exists LOF[*].PERC) & (LOF[*].PERC > 0.9)\" Warning We assume that 'test.snpeff.vcf' was annotated with SnpEff using '-lof' command line option. Available operands and functions The following operators and functions are interpreted by SnpSift filter : Operand Description Data type Example = Equality test FLOAT, INT or STRING (REF = 'A') > Greater than FLOAT or INT (DP > 20) \u2265 Greater or equal than FLOAT or INT (DP \u2265 20) < Less than FLOAT or INT (DP < 20) \u2264 Less or equal than FLOAT or INT (DP \u2264 20) =~ Match regular expression STRING (REL =~ 'AC') !~ Does not match regular expression STRING (REL !~ 'AC') & AND operator Boolean (DP > 20) & (REF = 'A') | OR operator Boolean (DP > 20) | (REF = 'A') ! NOT operator Boolean ! (DP > 20) exists The variable exists (not missing) Any ( exists INDEL) has The right hand side expression is equalt to any of the items in a list consisting of separating the left hand side expression using delimiters: & , + , ; , , , : , (', ') , [', '] . Example: If the expression is: ANN[*].EFFECT has 'missense_variant'. If left hand side (ANN[*].EFFECT) has value 'missense_variant&splice_region_variant', then it is transformed to a list: ['missense_variant', 'splice_region_variant'] Since the right hand side ('missense_variant') is in the list, the expression evaluates to 'true' Any (ANN[*].EFFECT has 'missense_variant') Function Description Data type Example countHom() Count number of homozygous genotypes No arguments ( countHom() > 0) countHet() Count number of heterozygous genotypes No arguments ( countHet() > 2) countVariant() Count number of genotypes that are variants (i.e. not reference 0/0) No arguments ( countVariant() > 5) countRef() Count number of genotypes that are NOT variants (i.e. reference 0/0) No arguments ( countRef() < 1) Genotype Function Description Data type Example isHom Is homozygous genotype? Genotype isHom( GEN[0] ) isHet Is heterozygous genotype? Genotype isHet( GEN[0] ) isVariant Is genotype a variant? (i.e. not reference 0/0) Genotype isVariant( GEN[0] ) isRef Is genotype a reference? (i.e. 0/0) Genotype isRef( GEN[0] ) Using sample names instead of sample numbers As of version 4.1A, SnpSift allows to use sample names instead of sample numbers. This allows to create more readable expressions.

Introduction SnpSift is a toolbox that allows you to filter and manipulate annotated files. For older version of this page, see: Manual page for SnpSift version 4.1 Once your genomic variants have been annotated, you need to filter them out in order to find the \"interesting / relevant variants\". Given the large data files, this is not a trivial task (e.g. you cannot load all the variants into XLS spreadsheet). SnpSift helps to perform this VCF file manipulation and filtering required at this stage in data processing pipelines. Download and install SnpSift is part of SnpEff main distribution, so please click on here and follow the instructions on how to download and install SnpEff. SnpSift utilities SnpSift is a collection of tools to manipulate VCF (variant call format) files. Some examples of what you can do: Operation Meaning Filter You can filter using arbitrary expressions, for instance \"(QUAL > 30) | (exists INDEL) | ( countHet() < 2 )\" . The actual expressions can be quite complex, so it allows for a lot of flexibility. Annotate You can add 'ID' and INFO fields from another \"VCF database\" (e.g. typically dbSnp database in VCF format). CaseControl You can compare how many variants are in 'case' and in 'control' groups. Also calculates p-values (Fisher exact test). Intervals Filter variants that intersect with intervals. Intervals (intidx) Filter variants that intersect with intervals. Index the VCF file using memory mapped I/O to speed up the search. This is intended for huge VCF files and a small number of intervals to retrieve. Join Join by generic genomic regions (intersecting or closest). RmRefGen Remove reference genotype (i.e. replace '0/0' genotypes by '.') TsTv Calculate transition to transversion ratio. Extract fields Extract fields from a VCF file to a TXT (tab separated) format. Variant type Adds SNP/MNP/INS/DEL to info field. It also adds \"HOM/HET\" if there is only one sample. GWAS Catalog Annotate using GWAS Catalog. DbNSFP Annotate using dbNSFP: The dbNSFP is an integrated database of functional predictions from multiple algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT and MutationTaster, PhyloP and GERP++, etc.) SplitChr Split a VCF file by chromosome Citing SnpSift In order to cite SnpSift, please use the following example .
